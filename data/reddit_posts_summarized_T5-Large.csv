0,Midtown manhattan Studio with great view,"$5000 for a studio 😕 it comes with personal training from jimmy butler? man, idgaf if it’s nyc. yes, it’s beautiful with great amenities but $5k in rent for a studio is outrageous. crazy i’ve run past this building many times and always wondered about the units.  pretty sick! if ur not making 200k a year. this ain't realistic and honestly if ur making 200k a year and browsing reddit for an apartment.... ur probably not making 200k annually honestly, the rent is ludicrous, but those amenities are really awesome. also, i wouldn’t market this as midtown, more grand central, or even tudor city/un adjacent. there’s a ton of great japanese restaurants around there for anybody looking to move to the area, but otherwise it’s pretty quiet after work hours. lol advertising with jimmy buttler in it? that means they will scoff at me if i even attempt to set foot in the building 5000 thousand for a studio. even the amenities don’t make up for it you can find studios within the 3-4k range with the same amenities in the city in arguably better neighborhoods than midtown. 5k can get you a 1 bedroom with same amenities even i would say. my friend lived in this building. the view and location are amazing, sure, but the units themselves are really shoddily constructed and the management could be aggressive and unprofessional (unless if you’re an nba player, then they’ll be at your beck and call). for that price, it’s unacceptable for $5000 i want a butler lol. hi guys i am relocating because of work and have this apartment up for lease takeover, there is one year remaining on the lease, and is 4975 a month. this price is the lowest in the building.  lowest price in the building!!      luxury living in nyc:   experience the ultimate in luxury living above it all. enjoy stunning views of the chrysler building, access to top-notch amenities including a rarely crowded gym, sauna, and swimming pool, and the vibrant lifestyle of new york city. live through the clouds in this exclusive and spacious studio.      \*\*address:\*\*   222 e 44th st, new york, ny 10017-4325, united states      \*\*facilities include:\*\*   - swimming pool   - full-court basketball (often used for nba star training)   - gym (barely crowded)   - free yoga classes   - sauna   - lounge with free coffee   - cinema   - terrace bbq   - doorman   - golf simulator      \*\*new york spacious studio:\*\*   - marble bathroom   - overlooks new york midtown   - direct view of the chrysler building   - one-year lease      please contact me if you are interested i pay 5350 for a 1k sqft one bed in the same location, better view and better amenities. 4975 for this is robbery $5k to sleep in the kitchen, nope. the hell with the other amenities, it has a washer and a dryer! what i’d do for one of those. nope. fuck that fam the coffee and yoga aren't free, you're paying $5grand a month for them hahah hey i have that garbage can cogs in the machine [removed] get a bedroom i could cut a deal and stay in a hotel every night for this much and get my bed made every day. eh. if you’re into this sort of thing (midtown 🥴) i can almost see my apartment from your window view if your paying 4975 a month, and that is 30% of your income (the suggested amount to spend on housing) that means you need to make 16,600 a month or 199,200 a year after rent after tax, and with how high taxes are, that means you would have to make an estimated 330,000 a year! what’s your job man? a view worth every penny 🏙️ everyone replying complaining about the price as if op controls it 5k for that isn’t even that bad. is it crazy expensive yes and this should absolutely not be the standard but i see “luxury” studios in the middle of bum fuck westchester go for 3-4.5k with less amenities. damn no dishwasher? if i am paying 5k a month i want a dishwasher lol does it come with jj redick?  👀👀 i’ll give you $2. f this market 🤦🏻‍♂️ holy fuck. $4500 to stare at your kitchen while watching tv from your bed. woof. lol that’s my exes apartment complex the kitchen is right next to entrance door. ppl really want to live in nyc that bad. jeez. i'm in tribeca (reade st). i own my condo, but the identical unit below mine rents for, i think, $6700, and it's a 909 sq ft 1.5br with a balcony and an amazing view (floor to 9ft ceiling windows). in unit w/d, glassed in shower, huge breakfast bar, deep soaking tub, walk-in closet. but no amenities. never pay for amenities.      tribeca > midtown laundry  in unit is a major win. ![gif](giphy|pyoyqrpyzxyq7mfxxs|downsized) ohhh this is where chris brickley trains all those players there are so many videos on youtube of nba stars playing pick up games at this building, living here basically means the rent includes you getting to play basketball with james harden and kevin durant etc. my friend lived there last year i visited for a few days, it really is a nice building and area. i saw a few famous people right outside on separate occasions just doing normal stuff and minding their business. a lot different than l.a for sure 😂 5k for a studio that’s crazy 😆 no apartment is worth renting for $5000 u/starkxsy - if you want to delete and repost this so it doesn't have a million comment from people scoffing at the price, please feel free, and pm me and i will lock the comments i lived right near there, it’s not a bad area. if you can afford it, it’s a sweet crib. i’d be on that golf simulator nonstop is it your bed on the first picture??? can't help you right now but curious to know what do you do for work. it's my dream to live in one of these in the city one day : ) ngl, the place looks amazing it's all relative.  if you are pulling in 400k thanks to being in ny, you pay the price and also have an incredible city downstairs.   great food, bars, nightlife, biking, parks.   i'd choose that life. careful sharing pics there  i might actually kill for that how much was your salary before the relocation? does it come with a shoe in a case and an unimpressed ukranian? gorgeous views and the amenities look great, but that’s a tiny studio. i’ve lived in two studios in my life and they were spacious, l-shaped. i’m not sure if i could blow that much money on such a small place (if i had it). i think i’d see how much space my $5k could get me elsewhere. i’m interested just saw someone asking for a studio for 1200 lol. how many sq ft is that 350? $5k does seem to be the starting price for a luxury midtown studio. prices have really shot up, especially for prime areas like midtown and west village. show the cat. normal people really don’t have that type of money nowadays. the country is a financial wreck. dream apartment if only it were 1900 i would’ve been right there playing wit jimmy buckets $5000/mo for a studio should be illegal i would hate to live in midtown did you sell a kidney for it? came to write $5k in the comments before cliccing the vid look im deadass sturdy you have a great view of other people's more reasonably priced apartments. i’m interested in this. can you dm me please? what kinda pc do you have there? holy fuck this building 🤤 what a dream studio nothing against op but that’s some bs studio price. at least it actually look a bit luxury. that’s beautiful 5k for a studio hell the fukkkk nawwww. even if i could afford it i still wouldn't take it. that view is insane jeez i get it that this is market rate but… do you guys realize that pretty much all your “excess” new york city earnings are being taxed away through taxes, crazy rent and everything else (like groceries) being too expensive? just curious…are all of those amenities included in the rent? i have a friend whose sole job is to handle amenities and most of them require tenants to pay an extra fee. random jimmy butler pic? i would cry if i lived here omg it’s a dream 😭 nah couldn't do it, i'd rather not live in the epicenter 👀 gorgeous apt. literally my dream. need more income though😂 $2k take it or leave it for all that money the apartment should come with a complimentary bangmaid lol while high, if you factor in not having to commute, a gym and a pool for use this isn’t terrible. gyms can be be what $200 a month? a pool membership is hard to get anywhere, so with everything the rent is more like $3-4k a month couldn't do it. i wanna see nature when i look outside not buildings 🤣 what do you do to afford this?? 😭😭 or pay half that for a place twice as big in a neighborhood that actually has some character? that view is fire!!! wish i could afford it 😂 wow, so cheap! this might make for a nice second place for my kid. i think i've inspected this building how much? living in chicago with similar amenities and views for half the price + 1 bedroom instead of studio. absolutely shocked new york is that expensive 222 east 44th. unit 23d is available for $4,895 mo. here's what 5k gets you in paradise valley, az, one of the country's priciest zip codes: [https://www.realtor.com/rentals/details/3411-e-valley-vista-ln\_paradise-valley\_az\_85253\_m21665-09911](https://www.realtor.com/rentals/details/3411-e-valley-vista-ln_paradise-valley_az_85253_m21665-09911) is jimmy butler the personel basketball trainer there ? so it’s an ad lol and it’s in midtown all that money for a studio with an easy bake oven. just s random flick on mr buckets? is jimmy buttler included in the price ? hmm those views for around $5000 in ny sounds like a steal. because i’ve seen some crummy ones for the same. i’d just sit at the window all day enjoying that view beautiful wtf awww the chrysler is my favorite. i try to not be impressed, but this makes me weak. i can only imagine how glorious at night, on the floor, with a cat and snacks. that can’t be the lowest price in the building because my friend has a studio in the exact same building exact same layout and last she told me her rent was $2000 something that view is crazy! i’d be working from home at 2x productivity with that view first, i need to find $5,000. brb i really can’t believe nyc is that much more expensive than the rest of the us. this would be 1/4 the price in a very nice area of downtown atlanta. aka what i pay i had a one night stand with a girl who lived here and it is what made me want to move from li i’m in cambridge, ma and the average rent here for a 1br is around $3900. so, the price for it being nyc sounded like a great deal. plus, washer & dryer! it’s the small things that make life easier. the view might actually look like this but for everyone viewing please be aware of obvious photoshop. i don't care where you live, more than $1000 for a studio is fucking criminal. 5k/mo is nothing compared to the liberation of  mandalor! not bad    i pay $4260 in long island fir 1 bedroom that view sucks lol i was expecting it to cost a lot more!!! it’s priced to be exclusive (read: keep people they don’t desire out).   i live in a luxury condo overlooking the water with glass walls and a w/d too. it’s great to come home to but tiny spaces get old. i have other rooms to go to but can’t imagine only having a single studio space. i did that when i moved to nyc long ago. my mortgage is less than that and i’m in westchester",1622,289,positive,0.5385751128196716,1911,is insane i’ve run past this building many times and always wondered about the units. a million dollars a year. a million dollars a year.uck brooklyn and i miss nyc. i’m not even making 200k a year. i’m making 200k a year. i’m making 200k a year. for 5k for.?

2,Those with high rise skyline apartments do you ever get used to/bored of the view? And is it worth it?,"i didn’t live in one but i worked at an office in hudson yards on the 72nd floor and the view never got old. i got used to it. i never got tired of it. i got used to mine, but continued to vicariously live through other people when they saw it the first time. impressed my girlfriend at the time enough to become my wife so all in all worth it.   but after 6.5 years of a 6 floor walk up i’m happy to be a ground floor dweller now. it never gets old for me. besides the view, i’ve noticed my apartment is very quiet. there are no bugs or rodents that make it up this high, either. totally worth it for me. https://preview.redd.it/ktgoakyjrxsd1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4aa5fc69e68eb6f4e2a39e681be1df032a4acdfc  never gets old. as for most things in life you eventually do get used to it but it is still nice it's hard to watch squirrels playing in a tree from there. my friends in hoboken had a view of the manhattan skyline for like 2-3 years. they became used to it after some time. they didn’t think it justified the rent. they were in there late 30s with a second child coming. they liked that location for the proximity to work and friends, the latter being across the street coincidentally   edit: curious, op, how much is your rent / how much does it cost for such a view in manhattan? my office view is similar to this, and i wouldn’t say it gets old but i don’t stop and look out as much as i did in the first few months of being there. you do become used to it.  if it’s worth it is a super personal choice. these views come at a very high premium. i’d rather spend the money on other things - location, space, amenities etc when i wake up and have time on the weekends with my cup of tea in hand and stare out the window for awhile. it never gets old for me. i lived in a high rise in tribeca for several years on the 49th floor looking north, i could see the entire city, the view never ever got old. i still think of it some nights when i'm falling asleep. probably the most interesting time was during the blackout of 2003, when we watched sections of the city get power back, all of a sudden a big chunk would light up while everything else was dark. at the time it was a bummer, because we were one of the last parts of the city to get power again, but it was very cool watching the city turn on like a lite-brite. never gets old to me.  https://preview.redd.it/yl8bdz5z8zsd1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0fa1ef22117e24d1778b74bf1100f5159d9797c i haven't had an nyc skyline view, but i paid about 1000/month in panama city for this view.  definitely worth it.  https://preview.redd.it/8zb3euqmwxsd1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cac636c5d657d89c7ac45fe7e41df1867be665e view? absolutely never boring for me! however, one of the downside living there is wait time for the elevator if you work regular office/school hour. especially when one of them is under maintenance. i have a balcony with a gorgeous view of manhattan.  seriously, i’ve had single friends ask permission to visit so they can show so my view at sunset.  there are times i forget about it, especially because i have large curtains over the door.  but there are other times where i bask in having it.  like during the pandemic i was on it all the time.  or on weekends i like to have a cup of coffee or a beer on it. is it worth it depends what you are giving up, if you are meeting all your needs and saving for your retirement then it’s worth it.  if you have doubts about your finance then i’d give up the views. i had a downtown brooklyn high rise from 2015-2019 during college. the view was spectacular but it was never permanent.  then i left nyc and came back. i live in a low rise harlem building now, but a spacious one 😊. we can see the empire state building from our living room window and it still rocks after 4 years. it does a light display on the hour! https://preview.redd.it/9d6peuersysd1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd2aa6a971249b999d383c3a8b119409f2b1984a  never gets old. still take photos of almost every sunset… even insomnia is a chance to glance out & take in how spectacular the city is. for tradeoffs, it was worth moving to brooklyn, though i would have loved to stay in ev if i’d found something i could afford there with views. i wouldn’t ever pay for a view but that’s a pretty rare sentiment among my friends.  for what it’s worth, that’s one of the better views i’ve seen. absolutely stunning! i got used to mine, but i still admire it from time to time. my cat has never loved it, though 😅 it’s my favorite part of my apartment and i’m going to end up broke because i can’t imagine living somewhere without a view now 8 years and it still puts stars in my eyes. i wake up before sunrise even on my off days to watch it change with the sun.    we still take breaks from our day to stop and admire the view. it feels like we have front row seats to the wonders of the earth every day.   to me, it’s worth every penny. https://preview.redd.it/1kzp7tpja1td1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3b646fa603bbfe767a530f7134c036153a841a7  still takes my breath away! i had a good view of the manhattan skyline from an apartment in brooklyn for about 2 years.  every night i had a little ritual of looking out the window before i closed the shade to go to bed and saying, ""good night, new york!""  (then a building went up right next to me and i had a view of a wall...)  i would say yes, actually, having a good view is worth a lot. i would take a smaller apartment or a worse location to get a good view. not that you're actively thinking about it all the time, but your scenery really does impact your quality of life in just the way you feel on a daily basis. every client’s ph or near top floor apartment i’ve ever been in during the last 25-20yrs (i work in the tech side of high end residential) all have a telescope. not a single one of those telescopes are facing up. 👀 the view is stunning. it’s even better from brooklyn so would rather get a place there. i don't know if it counts as high rise, but been on the 11th floor with a beautiful view of soho/downtown/wtc for the last 9 months and not bored of it yet, but definitely forget to notice sometimes. moved from west coast townhouse in the burbs to a high rise in midtown.   view never gets old but i’m always thinking about the price i pay for it. so that sorta sucks. i’m always impressed with the view before i go to bed. i would prefer to work in an office that has these views for “free” than to pay an exorbitant amount of rent for the views at home.   i also find that living in a high rise makes me feel separated from the city, like i’m on a hill overlooking the city rather than being <i>in</i> the city. i’d feel much more fulfilled living in a beautiful brownstone than i would in a beautiful high rise, if i’m throwing that kind of money around i used to have unobstructed river to river views looking downtown from waverly street.  it was beautiful and never got old.  i miss those views every day. posting your rent should be required. never bored of the view or nyc! in fact, the view calms and quiets the city below forcing one to just sit still. its magical and worth it. my view in midtown east, 24th floor, and i never get sick of it! i’m amazed every day and night of the 4 years that i have spend in this apartment. i have a great deal so cost isn’t an issue. i used to live in the rockys and i also never got sick of those views and was amazed everyday when i would walk to work, how epic the mountain range was.  https://preview.redd.it/2mpl0s83vzsd1.jpeg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ff2fc7feb9ddee5d8dba24178b411a5fed61e25 100% worth it and never gets old. i never knew what i was missing before and now i’ll never be able to go back. the view is like live art i love it get a telescope there’s always something to look at i have a great unobstructed view of manhattan from the east river side. partner and i still stand and stare in awe most nights. i hope it never gets old i grew up with a view like this, and after 19 years at home it never ever got old. completely amazing experience not worth the price unless you’re making bank. i live in one and my wife and i love the view. we make combine of 300k and our rent is 4.5k.  we came from prewar ues apartment so… yeah i lived in a lic high rise for 4 years. loved every moment of it the natural light you get is easy to take for granted. particularly in the winter.  low apts not above the neighborhoods skyline can feel dark in the middle of the day. after 4 or 5 months the only  thing you notice about a view is your visitors admiring it.    spend on space . have been fortunate to have a gorgeous view in lic for the last 8 years. in the winter, i barely look out the window. but the rest of the year, i look at the sky around sunset almost every day. the pinks and oranges and purples are something i'll never get tired of seeing. honestly i would give everything to live here such a beautiful view it gets old for me, sometimes i forget to appreciate it when people come over or when i come home and all the lights are off and all you see is buildings. it’s super nice to appreciate. reminds me of when i arrive to my hotel on the 8th floor, opposite side of where the car is parked, and i need to travel to the car at least 2 more times. shit would get old real quick. not sure if this counts but i was on the 16th floor in my college apt in baltimore and i definitely got used to it pretty quickly. felt lonely and away from everything. we moved to the 8th floor in the same building and i liked it a lot better. more in the action but still privacy. currently on the 5th where i am now and i’d like to be up a few floors next time. i lived in a high apartment with great view of the city. it was really cool for a week and then just mildly nice after it. after a few months i got used to it and stopped really noticing it. i miss it now that i don’t have one anymore. it’s like a story from the arabian nights, jeweled city. my view is terrible. i just moved out of mine of 24 months. i loved the view not a day i wouldn't watch the skyline and the sunset. it's surreal!! i’ll never get bored of my current view. and it’s definitely worth it. i work at a place with a view. doesn't get old, but also the value added does diminish to below what you have to pay to get it. money better spent on real value add like space and amenities or location. no way. i’ve had a few really great views in my time (i’m not rich i’ve just gotten really lucky) and to me a good window can be better than tv. and the sunrise/sunset views are something i will never get bored of. i have a high rise condo and it's the best purchase i've made. i never get tired of eating with the manhattan skyline views, sitting on the balcony on a bright night, i have views of central park on the other side of the condo. it's great when bringing people over you acclimate and don’t really think about it very often, but you do appreciate it some days. it’s probably not worth burning money solely for a view, but it’s a small luxury. no. yes. i had a really nice view for about 6 years and i stopped noticing it after a while. i was only reminded of it when guests would say something about it been with my current view for nearly two years and i still marvel at it almost every day.  that being said, i wouldn't pay extra for a view. i didn't choose this apartment based on the view. lived in one for 2 years. view never got old but i didn’t like going up and down 30+ elevator levels every time to go out. for me, it made me want to stay in more and leaving felt tiring. also many are in areas further away from transportation / things to do imo. now i live on 3rd floor of a smaller building and enjoy it much more views have never been a priority for me. i would trade marginal space / layout for marginal views. i miss it so much that i’m ready to jump through hoops to have it back next year i only lived on a high floor for 3 years, but no, i never tired of it. i loved watching the moon from my couch. i have so many pictures of sunsets and rainbows from that time and time lapses of traffic. our view was so much nicer than the actual neighborhood we lived in that it was always striking to walk through our front door. i regularly walked in saying, “aw, it’s beautiful!” never used to or bored of it, but yeah for what i’m paying it’s only worth it for one fun year. i’ll enjoy it then go somewhere cheaper without it i live on the 39th floor in downtown brooklyn. i grew up in a 2nd floor apartment in queens. i miss being able to hear the birds and stick my head out the window. the view is nice but i do forget about it sometimes except during sunset and sunrises. otherwise sometimes the sun is too intense i have to pull the blinds down. i wouldn't get tired of the view, but i'd get tired of living in a little box up in the sky. you get used to it, but it does not get old.  every once in a while you take pause and a step back in reflection, and admire it again almost as if you’re looking at it for the first time. yeap, you barely even notice it is there. i had great views in both miami and los angeles and i did get used to it but never bored. it always felt rewarding to look outside when having coffee or drinks on the 24th floor., view of the river during sunrise.  i have a dog so i'm up to see a lot of them. yes i’ve lived here 3 years no and i totally take the great views for granted. i don’t even look anymore. it’s crazy. my first high rise ever. it never gets old. never got used to it and still dream of it today and look at photos of it because the city view was so beautiful. been in one 4 years and still in awe. 😍 i’m in la, but yes! i’ve lived in the same place 4 years.  i have a beach view of coastline all the way to south orange county and i don’t even notice it. raised here. unfortunately that view does nothing for me anymore. i have to live vicariously through transplants who talk romantically about it yup, sadly, after a few years (3+) but you still enjoy your guest’s reactions to it when they visit lived in one for a few years and never got tired of it. coming home to this was very relaxing (vs seeing it in the office). there’s something about nyc do you have $500k that you can gift to me? i’m trying to building my dividend portfolio. thank you. i worked in the 50+ floor of the esb where our office was the entire floor and lived in a manhattan high rise but can't ever beat the 360 degree view of the former. no never we all have the same view from our houses no matter where or not we have an apartment. i agree with the person who said they like getting views from the office for free. that is what i do. although my building's rooftop terrace has stunning views too--i just have to go up there. my own apartment view is enjoyable and full of light, but just regular city life.  an apartment that hit every check box for me would probably be $7-8k per month, so i just have to let go of my wants. https://preview.redd.it/ix0013wis0td1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92d6b9681406c734636ad363c6f23c35d0ff3e72  no. will be sad when i have to leave it's worth it. we literally just lost our view (42nd floor facing manhattan) a few months ago and are moving because of it. truly had no idea how much it impacted our lives until we lost it. it’s like asking can one ever get used to a beautiful sunset or sunrise. i’d get bored of the cityscape but not the sky. can’t afford to live one but work in one and don’t ever get tired of it ❤️ serious question. how can i afford a high rise in manhattan? i lived on the 26th floor of an apartment building overlooking michigan ave just south of the river for a bit and i loved it every day. my daughter was 2 and we would spend quite a bit of time looking for things and playing i spy. grew up on the top floor of a building facing the george washington bridge and njs cliffs. didn't appreciate it until i moved away to an apartment without a view, in short you get used to it but miss it lots when no longer have it. my buddy's office was on the top floor of the empire state building. actually he had a desk as it was an open office.  the staff regularly hosted business meetings and a quick tour of the floor as it is an event for single person that visits. i was grateful for the visit and wish i had taken pictures. it’s not that the view got old, but there’s a lot of views out there... and as it turns out, life is short. never gets old!!! ngl - even with a halfway decent view, it never gets old. i have a clear view of 1wtc and the roof has a clear view of almost the entire manhattan and brooklyn skyline. it will never get old and i can spend hours just staring at it. was it worth the few $100 each month above a standard apartment; absolutely. do i feel like an entitled pr*ck sometimes when people want to spend $$$ to go to a rooftop bar; you bet!!! i lived in an apartment with pretty nice view of lower/mid manhattan on one side with hudson bay on the other side. you get used to it pretty quickly and stop appreciating it. you'll notice it again when guests get awed by the view and forget shortly after. it isn't worth it if it's significantly more expensive than without the view. i don’t think i would ever get bored of it personally as someone who has yet to live in one. i work in a building with barely a good view and it still makes me look out often. i’ve had both city views and nature views in places i’ve lived.  the city views get old.  the nature views don’t.  but that’s my experience i’ve gotten used to it but definitely not bored of it.  long island city isn’t cheap but it’s also not absurdly expensive for a 2br/2ba.  the weird thing though is due to my apartment layout i often have to shut the blinds if i want to watch tv at certain times of the day, and that feels weird…. it’s like having an original art piece and covering it up. it never gets old. it is always wonderful to look out of your windows or sit on your balcony and enjoy the beautiful view and observe all the activity. like anything of course you become adjusted to something over time. doesn't make it any less beautiful and if you can get present enough you'll see it like you're seeing it for the first time. also it's beautiful to share and i always loved that like bringing someone over and them seeing it for the first time. i’d blow my brains out before i’d have windows like this. yes and no. at times it becomes “normal”, like that’s just my home and there’s some comfort in that. but at times when i go relax on the balcony or have friends over, it’s absolutely beautiful. woah, i live here, what an amazing life i have and i’m so grateful. when friends or family come over and are amazed at the view, it puts things into perspective. definitely have a view at my place. i never get bored of it but at times i certainly take it for granted not even noticing it or looking at it for weeks. it adds an ambiance to my daily life but only when i stop and mindfully observe it. nice view btw! it’s certainly different from mine but just as beautiful. i was in one for about 11 months…. not really that long but i definitely didn’t get board of it. tbh, i’m in jc now and don’t want to move back to the city until i can afford to get back to a place with a killer view.   just like everything in life people like variety…. there’s an old saying “for every beautiful girl, there’s a guy tired of fucking her”. that person whose tired of the view is probably tired of the city if i am booking a hotel, i never pay extra for a view room, but i am delighted if upgraded to one. if i consciously paid extra for a view apartment (beyond about $100/month), i would be thinking what i could be using that money on. if u get bored put on a curtain a view of the ocean and sky is beauty? who wants to look at buildings how ugly... if you're from bumfuk idaho (as it appears you are), keep posting shxt like this. it fits you maturity level.",1338,249,positive,0.7256765961647034,1587,i was on it all the time. or on weekends i bask in having it. or during the pandemic i was on it all the time. or on weekends i like to have a cup of coffee on it. or on weekends i like to have a beer on it. it never gets old for me. if you are meeting all your needs and saving for your retirement then it’s worth it. if you are living in
3,The rent crisis in NYC is becoming increasingly unbearable,"two incomes no kids. tell me about it, i literally cannot afford to move out of my parents home and it drives me insane one that pays $160,000/yr i guess.. yeah and even if you could afford to pay 4k in rent, should you? that’s 48k a year down the drain. 4 roommates.   seriously though, most people are not affording 4k, 2k is a stretch for most people despite what you might think based on listing prices. even ‘affordable’ units are really expensive in the new buildings near me - like double what my two bedroom is. i’ve always wondered this. not everyone in the city can be a lawyer, doctor, engineer, finance person, creative exec, sales manager, etc. are so many people in rent stabilized/controlled apartments? are most people in 1 bedrooms a couple? what jobs do people do that allow them to live alone or with roommates in west village/williamsburg/fort greene/greenpoint, etc? add in insane broker fees and it feels impossible. roommates are the answer here. looking in areas where the average rent isn’t 4k a month. or enter the housing lottery and pray you win. as a single person, it's unbearable. half my rent goes to a tiny studio. our society expects us to become lawyers and doctors in order to afford to properly survive here but couldn't function off of just doctors and lawyers. gets kind of jarring to go to the source of production to a plant that's responsible for feeding thousands of families to see a bunch of dirt poor people grinding away 18 hours a day.   nyc is where it all gets profound. a city that expects the wages of wall street tycoons that relies entirely on the backs of the underpaid and overworked.   i hate reality. three types of ppl that lived in manhattan:  1) high earners and/or odd hours workers. 2) lots of roommate.  3) daily ramen eaters. yeah, it's difficult to do or justify if you have the means.  most rentals in south bk are going for around 2-2.5k for 1 br, 2br are rare in this price range.  i currently pay $2,500 w/ no utilities included. started at $1,800 in the pandemic. i do work a high paying job and still have trouble justifying it in my mind. i live on the edge of boro park and really feel like a (comfortable) outsider here, not much in the neighborhood to enjoy when not a part of the culture. living in a more popular area would be even worse, since you would always have temptation to spend money in the neighborhood.   anyways, yeah it sucks, tbh lot of areas outside of the city aren't that much cheaper after you factor in car ownership. its a rough and strange time. rich parents, old and ""worked their way up"", dink or finance/tech/medicine/law/sales mommy and daddy are subsidizing their living expenses. my very large 1br (1200 square feet) was 1550 heat and hot water included on si when i moved in early 2020 it's now 1800 and i'm moving out in april because i found out it's not rent stabilized and they are jumping the rent to 3300 we ditched our high priced wburg pad several years ago and went to what we thought was a far out neighborhood - ditmas park. got a rent stabilized place. now? omg waves of young parents are moving out here from park slope, fort greene, etc, driving rents through the roof.   anyway, thats how we afford being here and are able to save money. the job of being in a relationship. partially kidding but not really. getting married is literally saving me tens of thousands of dollars in expense a year. at least until we have a kid at some point, then we’re fucked again. some kid 19 or 20 years old i know , she lives in dumbo rent around $5000.00 , i asked her how ? answer : her dad who owns a hedge fund has bought that place lol 😆 another student in williamsburg, asked her how ! answer was her dad is a famous millionaire… another lady but very old by central park , has private elevator to her apartment and has bought another apartment in the same building just to leave it empty as her “guest house “ .. her secret ? she is related to rockefellers family finance, particularly investment banking. and tech. and fintech. get rich which is why i moved out of nyc. it got to the point i couldn't justify it anymore manhattan chinatown with housemates. tiny 3bedroom 1 bathroom is $3500. but, we have tall ceilings so lots vertical storage!    our incomes are 70k, 80k, and 300k. admissions officer, editor at some information compilation company, small biz owner. roommates help, but there are plenty of studios/1bds under that price if you look in certain neighborhoods.  but for desirable areas of the city, yea it’s gotten pretty brutal. with rates as high as they are, buying is an even worse idea, so it’s a bit of a lose-lose right now. i’m a nurse that makes 120k a year and lived in bk my whole life. i refuse to pay the ridiculous prices in nyc. so i moved to jersey, they’re around the same prices but at least you get more space.   i’ve also tried affordable housing ,which i find ridiculous that i should even have to do or qualify for because they’re are people out there who truly need it, and the rent is the same as the market value. it seems like the working middle class who didn’t move from the midwest and who’s mommy and daddy pay half their rent are screwed. soon new york will not have any of the original residents that make “trendy” and cool city that it once was, it will be full of migrants and explants  anyway vote that bald man out and vote for someone who will fix the housing crisis and stand up to the cooperations building “affordable housing “ only to let half of their units be empty. most people aren't paying full rent alone. a lot of people share spaces, either with roommates or a so. i would guess that most people renting in the city, especially manhattan, are living with multiple other people. i signed my 3.1k lease when i was making around $150k then got fired haha.  wasn't in a position to delay getting a job, but could only get one that pays 40% less. so, i am not able to casually afford my rent anymore and am scrambling to find affordable but decent housing in the city without roommates. feels impossible. there are a lot of high paying jobs here. lots of finance bros and tech people make more then enough to cover that rent. my sister in law is about to be a doctor not even done with residency yet and has a contract to start at over $300k. my wife and i make 90k each so we actually could apply for these ridiculous apartments (4k x 40 is $160k). if either of us were to get fired, hurt or pregnant we would be fucked. if either of our cats got hurt that would blow our budget too. we would also never be able to save enough money to prepare for an emergency either.  it just doesn't make sense. [deleted] [deleted] i just got priced out. when my lease is up i have to leave the city . i have roommates too and still can’t afford it . i’m wondering how is it like to live in manhattan these days. with migrants, homelessness being rampant, i don’t see nyc the same as it was pre covid. love to hear opinions of people actually living there right now. it’s literally ridiculous. at this point they’re tryna only have the rich live in nyc. you can’t even live there comfortably by yourself if you make regular income. this is coming from someone who lives in nyc and lovesss nyccc!! they’re literally trying to cause a recession at this point haha, in my country we have 80% home ownership, because companies that buy residential homes pay an added 60% tax so it's not very viable i genuinely recommend chicago to a lot of ppl bc you can get a decent size 3 bedroom in northern part, safe area for 2-3k. income here is a little bit  less, but you can live very very comfortable here. there are nearly 1 million millionaires in nyc. that's about 1 out of every 7 residents. would you think prices would be ok for them? not much of a burden, in return for supermodels, sushi at midnight, and the met.  > new york city is home to nearly 1 million millionaires, more than any other city in the world  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/new-york-city-has-more-millionaires-than-any-other-city-in-the-world.html i work a full-time job and two part-time jobs. and i barely go out. i remember visiting my friends in new york city/jersey city like in 2016/2017 and that time on average they were paying somewhere to 1600-1800 on rent. and that's with having a roommate. you don't find those kind of prices anymore for a nice place. when compare rent  to the standard cost of living, salaries and what not it's become more unaffordable. absolutely out of control. so glad i was lucky enough to buy in late 2022. now at 2200 for mortgage and maintenance when i'd probably be paying 3k to rent a similar 1 bed i make $100k. rent is $2350 in astoria. it’s doable! [deleted] i got a rent controlled place in hoboken for $1200 - wasn’t easy to find but i’m able to save a lot i only make 110k i’m more comfortable where are you trying to live? plenty of nice 1beds for under $3k east of 3rd on the ues. two income household is how we do it, ~185,000 combined. on my income alone i couldn’t possibly afford my neighborhood. i mean how many normal working people live in the expensive parts of the city? i assume 80% of the people in soho, eastville,  tribeca,  have some sort of generational wealth or rent stabilized. most working people live above 90th street, brooklyn,   queens , bronx. rent stabilized apartment. my neighbors leave their prada boots in the hallways to dry out. point is majority of ppl not even making 100k in nyc. the rents are out of control and the fact that a bunch of out of towners have normalized becoming roomates to pay 1200 a month or more each for one room in an apt has decreased rentals for working families. raising a family in any borough in ny for middle class families has become near impossible so imagine the poor. its only a matter of time before a majority get pushed out unless they are willing to work 70-80 hrs a week to stay. terrible. i live in astoria and my roommate and i each pay $1400/month for a good size apartment with a balcony. two blocks from the n train in a good location. we are both 26 and she’s a teacher and i’m in hr. it’s possible but you def need to search around and have a roommate. my so and i share a $6300 gorgeous apartment in the east village and split rent 50/50; we're early thirties, he makes $180k (tech entrepreneur) and i make $225k base (pm in growth stage tech). i have $2k in student loans a month, so at the end of the day our take home is basically the same (hence the split). it's tight every month and i'd say we live kind of paycheck to paycheck, but we love our building and apartment and the idea of moving is not something we want to do yet. i'm maxing out my 401k and get a bonus / rsus every year that goes straight to savings, so i wouldn't say i'm saving the way i should be, but i don't feel poor anymore. i know that it's temporary so i'm ok with it. that said, there's 0 chance we could afford a child or even a dog right now. idk just be less poor ig my wife and i (plus one kid) are living on the uws. rent is almost 7k. i work in it, my wife in banking. together we make almost 500k. i honestly don't know if that's a lot for ny standards.. but we can live quite comfortably with it.  p.s. i wouldn't say we spend it ""casually"" on rent. it a lot of money for sure. live in queens a quick streeteasy search with the right parameters returns plenty of nice places for under $4k. but to answer your question from my personal situation our jobs are tech sales and it training. though i wouldn’t say we can “casually” afford rent, just afford it. wow i was applying to grad school in nyc (coming from la) and these comments scare the fuck out of me. if by ""nyc"" you mean ""soho, chelsea, midtown, ues, uws"", then yes, it is ""unbearable"". surprisingly, though, there are also other parts of the city, even ones that have access to public transportation, restaurants, and even sometimes attractions. honestly, idk why people live in nyc. it appears more and more  that it is only for the wealthy to live in or visit. especially remote workers. roommates, or even better living together in a relationship its for couples who each pay $2k for a 1bd ($4k rent total). if you make $150k each, you can pool together your money to pay for a $5k-6k 1 bd (there aren't many 2bd available for even that price in manhattan) ""friends"" clearly shows it ain't that bad.. just have to have a roomie, whoopah! my partner and i make about $180k collectively and pay about $3k per mo w no kids, it’s been a lot easier than i anticipated, we’ve been very flush with cash. i think we could afford $4k per mo but that would suck up quite a bit of our extra cash. rather have a car loan for a lambo i lived with roommates for years after i “needed” to. i was making 120k in 2012 paying $600 in rent living with 4 friends in a shithole because i lived through the financial crisis of 08 and was scared to ever be that poor again. rent is wildly expensive.  a studio in my building rented last month for $3800 which is more than what i currently pay for my 1 bedroom! being in a relationship helps a lot… those are manhattan prices and it's called paying a premium for living in the city center.  go to staten island or some areas of brooklyn and queens and you'll see rent for 1400 to 1600 a month. that’s nuts. i pay $1500 on rent for a small house in upstate ny displacement displacement displacement. new comers just keep spreading further away from manhattan pushing the locals out. i live in a small town in nc and pay $1200 a month in rent alone.  my bring home is only 2400 a month.  single mom, make too much for any assistance, and everything is so fucking expensive.  shit is brutal. idk why people continue to post in nyc reddit in shock about how people afford rent that's over $4000. you guys realize that people in nyc have higher paying jobs right.... the rest live in bronx/queens/nj and commute in the west village is the most expensive and sought after neighborhood in the city. the people there are definitely paying $4500+ to rent a  tiny 1br 8n a walk-up without too ma ny amenities. they are very likely sharing with a partner/roomie/spouse, or have a wealthy guarantor or are in, (from my experience) the finance,  fashion, luxury goods, and/or entertainment industries with hefty paychecks. there is always a downside... i can't relate... i'm in a working class neighborhood in the bronx... new build, 2 bdrm $1950.  y'all pay those manhattan and bk prices if you want. the city just needs to demolish all public housing in manhattan—it’s a supply issue we all know why it’s happening and yet even a slight hint of it gets you socially ostracized and shunned. and i know you know what i’m talking about just by reading this.   we deserve these rents because we live in fear. 2 words: the. bronx. i am not going to say its not extremely high. i have spent a lot of time looking at meta data for street easy. you can get the data on median asking rents here:""  [https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/?agg=total&metric=inventory&type=sales&bedrooms=any%20bedrooms&property=any%20property%20type&mindate=2010-01-01&maxdate=2024-01-01&area=flatiron,brooklyn%20heights](https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/?agg=total&metric=inventory&type=sales&bedrooms=any%20bedrooms&property=any%20property%20type&mindate=2010-01-01&maxdate=2024-01-01&area=flatiron,brooklyn%20heights)  i have a few observations.  1. median asking rent varies a lot by neighborhood. when you hear the 4k number thats mostly because of manhattan. there are a loooot of neighbrohoods where the median rent is well under 2500$ for a studio. several parts of queens have median rents under 2000$. even some relatively trendy places are well under 2500$  like astoria. place like east village, upper east side, park slop, bushwick seem to be right at 2500$. 2. new york the sweet spot for renting is actually a 3 bedroom. basically most people working ordinary jobs have to have room mates. for example astoria is 2100 for a studio and 3600 for  a 3 bedroom,  bushwick is 3600 as well. 3. one and two bedrooms seem to be generally bad value propositions. basically they are luxuries.  i am basing this on january data, but trends hold  over time. tldr, people that make 80 to 100k can afford the median studios in many neighborhoods. there are several neighborhoods where 3 room mates can afford the median a 3 or more bedroom apartments as long as they each make 50k to 60k. one and two bedroom apartments seem to be luxury goods. i wanted to move to nyc like 10 years ago so i went to youtube to see tips and tricks. the trick was to share a bedroom with 3 other people.  i watched a video of a girl do a video in her bedroom, which she shared with 3 other people and was paying just under $800 a month. yep that’s why i said fuck new york and moved to north carolina. i pay 1200/month for a 1 bedroom tired of people acting like that is a the cost of an apartment here, there are 10,000 apartments currently on street easy listed at less than $4,000 and only 5,000 above that price. also a significant amount of apartments are rent controlled and the average amount that new yorkers pay is actually very low. tech, finance, law, pr, medicine... [deleted] i mean the starting salary at a tech company is around 140k not including bonus + stock also, consider building maintenance fees taked onto rentals/coop/hoa fees. its not just apt owners that pay these fees. i hear you. even making 160k as a couple with $2500 rent, we decided to move in with my in laws to pay off debt and accelerate savings. and i’m now realizing there’s no way out! can’t afford the mortgage on anything short of a crack house near boston. ha! what happened to the airbnb apartments?  they should have lowered the rent. 300 salary- physician. 4500 rent. needed 2 beds for parents. its too expensive and limits my savings. i love the city but its becoming unaffordable they say nyc is about 35% under for what they really need for housing. so you’re going to see a lot of condos/apartments being built over the next 5-8 years. will it help ease the rental amounts? probably not! 85k but i bought a house in bergen county. with my partner working in nj, dink, it's pretty comfortable but i also wfh 4 days a week so that helps with time/expense. tenant strikes bby! living in nyc means i have access to diff options for childcare and transportation - so while still expensive it costs me less than what it would out in the suburbs - therefore making it easier to pay rent they expect ppl to room in apts 4-5 deep my apartment in queens was $1700 last year. right off fresh pond, tons of stuff to do. but anyone from manhattan feels like they have to catch a flight to get to me. trade offs. rent stabilized apartment. i pay $1825ish and it’s a struggle, but i live by myself, so the extra money vs roommates is worth it it’s insane n unbearable. we’re gonna reach a crisis point very soon because even ppl making 6 figures n perfect credit can barely afford a place. maybe the dip shit mayor will do something once the rich ppl start complaining more i mean avoid manhattan and you’ll find some gems throughout the city pshh that's only 1.5 daycare bills. light work.  no but seriously, very easy to find places with $4k rent and $2.5k/mo daycare. i can't fathom how so many parents of one kid make this city work, let alone multiple.   then i remember it's confirmation bias. we don't see all the families this shit pushed out. i found a 1br for $1800 during the pandemic. i guess i will be living here until i die. my rent stabilized 3bed1bath with roommates in brooklyn has a current and urgent ceiling cave-in, the fifth we've had my wife and i are in a unit at $4200. we came from houston in october where we were paying half that for nearly 3x the space (we also had a one acre dog park which our pup sorely misses). we moved because my wife made a career change to publishing which essentially means living here or boston. i work in finance and i’m still doing my old job but remotely now. it has been rough honestly and it’s the most i’ve worried about money since graduating. just hoping i can land a new job soon after i get my bonus next month and get a cost of living adjustment / general bump in pay.   we’re also looking to move to something cheaper when our lease is up and hope the market will cool some by then but i think we’re out of luck on that front. we’ve actually even considered buying something with how much our rent is but i don’t think that’ll realistically be in the cards either. live at home with my parents. their mortgage for 1600 sq ft is less than a 1br apt in manhattan… i got my 3 bedroom in harlem as part of a real estate transaction for the landlord and it’ll go back to fair market in 2060 but till then it’s ours for $1100 a month 🥰🥰🤐  sorta changed the game for me.",1256,371,negative,0.8410271406173706,1627,", she has a, she has a private elevator to her apartment and has a, she has a, she has a private elevator to her apartment and has a private elevator to her “guest house” .. her dad is a millionaire .. i cannot afford to move out of my parents home and it drives me insane. i that’s that’s or"
4,Happy Monday everyone,"i think average salary context is needed. take dublin for example? dublin salaries for example are atrocious compared to nyc so cost of rent is almost equivalent to a monthly salary me 🤝🏾 my rent stabilized apartment i used to live in kochi, kerala (india) for college and we  used to pay rs. 30,000 collectively ($375) a month for a two-story house in a gated community with a security guard 24/7 with 3 bedrooms + 3 bath, gorgeous balcony, tv, in unit washer-dryer. i miss the good old days. hk apartments in the city center are far more than $2250. 50-75% more.. i was paying that $2250 price 10 years ago and was a couple of stops away with around 400sq/ft. it also definitely was not the same finish that a $4k nyc apartment affords. also $2854 for a 1br in london is a stretch depending on how large ‘city center’ is defined by. i was paying that pre covid in paddington. i gather things have increased a fair bit since then. my friends in nyc think i paid $1.5 million for my place in chicago. paid $350k. it’s nice to live. toronto should be up there as well. comparatively low salaries with nyc-level col parasites run society yeah this isn’t helpful… has to be compared to average wages. sure shit is cheap elsewhere, but they also don’t provide wages anywhere close to major cities. nyc is so so fucking cooked soooo as a collective affording rent is basically the hunger games brooklyn is looking affordable at $1,744 the term ""city center"" is a little sus to me. what do they mean? in nyc , city center means aro6nd city hall downtown mamhattan and isn't necessarily super residential. it's literally city hall, the courts, etc.   if this is an overall nyc average, yeah sounds about right. but actual rent depends on the nieghborhood,  the building, amenities, the location. i'm in a 2  br in hk. rent is $3500 but i'm on the top floor of a 5 story walk-up. times  square stop/major transit hub  entrance is on the corner. it has its issues, no real living space unless we got creative, but we have a dishwasher and laundry in the basement.   the rental market in the city is incredibly challenging. i'm also in the business so i see and have needed to deal with it from both sides i am sympathetic over the challenges while also understanding of the market itself. as my great-grandmother and grandmother used to say (who had by my memory the most amazing 2 br in a 2 family home in elmurst, queens (i wonder how much rent thwy were paying)), you get what you pay for. you want are real lv bag or a canal street lv knock-off? apartments kind of the same thing and the market is super rn. in moments of scarcity and high demand,  prices go up. why would anyone look at avg. you have luxury apartments that brings up the avg. a quick search on streeteasy you will find a lot of 1br for 2.5k  i live in a luxury apartment and my 1br is 4k. most apartments in the city aren’t luxury  edit - https://imgur.com/a/g3tgavq  what the heck are ya searching? keep spreading fake news i am a foreigner living in a studio in the ""city center""  🙃  i've lived in both a less expensive city from the list and one that falls in the middle. ultimately, the choice depends on your financial situation and how much you're comfortable spending.  capturing the screenshot at exactly 11:11 can feel like a little moment of serendipity 😜 i've spent way too much time looking at street easy meta data. i've come to conclusion one bedrooms are a bad deal in new yorkn. the median studio in many neighborhoods is far more reasonable. like ues/park slope/ev/les studios the median price is 2500 give or take 200$. these infographics are so devoid of context as to be deceitful, if not totally worthless.  1) what is the average salary in these cities?   2) what is the ""city center"" of ny? i live in harlem - is that the ""city center""? (and i don't even pay 2k, let alone 4k, for a 1br)   3) is this the median price? the mean price?   4) do you need a car if you live in these cities? because that's a major expense which ny does not require residents to incur. ugh my 2 bedroom here is 4k. it’s rough 🥲 a few of these cities require a car to realistically get by. i can assure you, rent for a 1-bedroom in downtown boston is way more than $3100. huh, 12 of the top 13 most expensive cities are former british colonies. nyc is awful but how in the world does boston justify charging what it does? brb moving to milan would also like to see a list of cost per square feet to rent for the above cities. some cities 1 br apts are quite different in sizes people forgot that in milan an average salary is 1000-1800€ this seems wrong for nyc. i suppose if you’re only looking for luxury high rise then yea. thre is a premium to live in nyc. you can drive north a few hours, and your rent for a month will be far less than the price of omakase for 2 in manhattan.  you can live a month in a prison town on the cost for that one meal. rock bottom grocery store prices can feed you. if you like frozen seafood from china. bleached to death white flower bread, and high fructose corn syrup. you are in heaven! yummy!  nyc. super models and sushi at 1 am, world class everything, the list is endless, it's comes with a preminum.  as a friend was fond of saying:  ""in 22 seconds i saw more beautiful girls on the corner of prince and browdway than i have in 22 years in my home town. and i counted!""  these things will cost you. it's fashion week, i'm sure he would last less than 10 seconds before the first heart attack.  a new yorker will last less than a day  in a prison town. but the rent is soooooo cheap. for a reason.  as someone posted way back when, ""more than $700 a month for rent, for a 2 bedroom apartment?""  highway robbery!  that's insane!   etc. we all live in our own simulation.  :-) nyc is so expensive my sister lives in a $30m 5 storey brownstone in the upper east side…it’s only $15k a month.   maybe you guys should share a brownstone?? what about bridgton maine? crying in california rn concrete jungle where dreams are made of! download our app today for the chance to win a $100 visa gift card! my roommates and i had a tough time finding a sublease last summer. we spent tens of hours scrolled through facebook groups and various group chats, which was a real headache. that's why we built bili – it's like airbnb but for subleases. it makes finding or posting sublets super easy.  https://join.bili.dev we're winning!   also: build more housing. drown nimbys in the hudson or east river, whichever is more convenient. [deleted] jesus vancouver is only $2100? i’m really surprised hong kong is that affordable. it was known for having the highest real estate in the world. if it’s a couple that splits the rent, that’s actually decently priced.  for context, i really love hong kong. i used to live in china for several years, so i would hop over the border once or twice a month to hang out in hk for the weekend. i don’t live far away now, so i still drop by once in a while. great place! san diego should be included lol. $2300 for a one bed one is average amsterdam is way more expensive than what’s posted here if you’re actually in the city center. i used to pay €3000/month for a 1 bedroom in de pijp gross plus you have to midtown. woof. i’m moving to italy boston really? uhm... you forgot seattle, redmond, austin, and many other us cities where an average downtown 1 bedroom rent exceeds the last one on the list. yikes los angeles is misleading ly low, dtla is very far from the most desirable place to live in the city why does nyc keep growing   this .. this is why i left nyc because i was tired of getting ridiculous prices dictated to me with impunity. nyc is full of yuppies who don't seem to be saving anything and blowing through their 150k-200k salaries because ""yolo, we need to experience as much as we can"" while flexing their trips on ig, and kids from rich families. the only people i know who are really saving anything are making 300k, in stable relationships, moved to jersey, and who don't really go out at all.  it used to be that they could hustle during the post-covid boom and make a little more back. now money is harder to come by, i wonder how they're doing. how is it the whole world is experiencing the same issues 🤔? i doubt singapore is accurate. rent is increasing significantly - my previous apartment that i rented for $2500 went up to $3900. other apartments nearby also went up to similar range. i’m a native new yorker who also lived in milan and lausanne both were the same price as nyc. we aren’t the most expensive anymore tbh. everyone is sadly catching up to us.   during my time in philly for grad school, i remember nice apartments being half the price of nyc ones. that might still be true today. where is paris brooklyn is huge and u can find under 3000. i’m assuming they used dtla for that rent metric which isn’t a good place to measure. comparable area would def be higher up the list above miami for sure. no one is making you live in city center or in a 1 bedroom apartment. don’t pick the most expensive lifestyle to live, and then complain that it is expensive. useless without being adjusted for income how is washington d.c. not on this list? our rents make miami look like a non-profit organization. is that tel aviv number still accurate? i keep hearing that it’s extremely pricey, even with the war very curious to see this list compared to average annual income for each place and see the ratio between the two. ![gif](giphy|6zy5hbzj1h2za)  my reaction to this but i thought everyone was leaving new york and san francisco? i’m still poor by nyc standards, but to be fair i’m making 3x as much as when i still lived in florida — miami is insane for those prices. east jersey need to get added new york is headed for a nose dive.  once it happens all these nuts are going to scratch their heads and blame each other and get even more nutty on how to fix it.  all this while saying it’s the best place in the world 🤪 probably needs to be normalized to livable space. some '1 bedrooms' are shoeboxes with communal toilets. how's that american dream going? 😫 average city in russia ~150-200$  but problem is average income ~300$ it will only get more expensive to live in new york. without a dedicated program to build more affordable housing, the supply will not be able to keep up with demand. not sure the definition of city center but it would be hard to get a one bed for that in the city center in ny.  that may be the median one bed rent for all of manhattan, but isnt a real reflection of the city center, as it includes outlying areas like inwood and upper east harlem 12 miles away from downtown where an apartment can be had for 2500.",944,199,negative,0.4466367959976196,1143,"i've found the median price of a studio in many neighborhoods is far more reasonable. like ues/park slope/ev/les studios the median price is 2500 give or take 200$. 2) what is the median salary in nyc? i'm in dublin and my rent is about rs. 30,000 a month. i live in a 2 br in hk. rent is $3500"
5,Can I make this space work or am I delusional?,"that's tough if you need a work desk in there too. you should try to do better. needing to wfh in there + no closet + tiny bed might not be the best move how much and where?   that makes a big difference in what you should be willing to put up with. is there a particular reason you need to be in the east village? that just doesn’t seem worth it especially if you’ll be wfh. don’t do it jesus christ lol is this in midtown east? i swear i lived in a unit with a room that looked exactly like this.  anyway you'll need some galvanized steel and eco-friendly wood veneers. what are the dimensions? without knowing, we really can't say what would fit there.  that said...no way it's worth it lol the window appears to be one of those courtyard facing ones which will never get adequate sunlight no matter the time of day. for that reason, i would pass. op think do you really wanna pay $1600 for no closet, no space for a decent size bed, and no natural light? you might want to look into a japanese futon bed instead i mean you can do that if you’re cool with sleeping in a twin bed like a 5th grader don’t do it unless you’re absolutely dying to live in the neighborhood. i had a tiny bedroom like this when i first moved to the city and it gave me so much grief — the lack of storage and the smaller bed especially. i was in a nice apartment but my personal space was just not livable so don’t underestimate how important that is!!! it depends if your a homebody or not. if you are, i would highly advise finding a place with a window that looks out to the street.   this room is the only space in all of nyc that you can actually call yours. if you know your going to be working in that room all day and then spending your evenings and weekends in that same room, your going to go crazy. we new yorkers deserve bigger and better space with the amount of rent we pay. this is basically the size of a “big” closet. sucks you will have to be a minimalist here. keep it as simple as possible with the necessities. hope you find a better place in time. deff no for $1600 you can get a room in a nice and big apartment - a room with actual windows, a closet and some space! it is not worth living in the east village to live like this, especially if you work from home as a fellow new yorker, born and raised, i don’t know how people can accept these shoeboxes as rooms. if i cannot fit a queen sized bedroom set (bed, chest and dresser) in a room comfortably and still have room there is a problem. i need space. the only time i compromised space was in college and that was only for freshman year. after that i lived off campus. i swear i feel like my room is twice this size in park slope/prospect heights for only $200 more... not worth !! ev isnt even a good place to live imo but that's personal preference ofc for $500 sure, $1600 nope. i rather have a basement apartment or a small walk up studio all to myself. take your money and get a micro studio in queens it’ll be more space bestie. go to brooklyn or even queens and have an actual room you can live in. this is terrible for $1600. do yourself a favor, don’t confine yourself to this tiny box for almost 2k a month i know several people who have lived in a situation like this. your best bet is to get a raised bed and put a computer desk underneath it. you are going to need to measure the dimensions before trying this. good luck. eh i mean you def could do something with it, but i’d recommend to take your budget elsewhere into queens or brooklyn, maybe even uptown. you’ll be able to get a bigger space and you mentioned your office is in midtown (hybrid work). if ur only going into the office a couple days a week, a longer commute up to one hour isn’t bad, many new yorkers do it. i used to commute 1 hour by subway. in essence, you can find a much better space further away and it will probably be better for you in the long run. what's the rent? i hope it's not over $1000. it's a storage closet. who's offering this? no bathroom no kitchen. inmates at rikers have larger accommodations. yall, thanks to everyone for all the input! i literally am delusional when it comes to moving out and want to have a manhattan moment for a year. now after thinking this all through i don’t think i should take it. only issue is i applied with the 2 roommates, and one of them has a super tight deadline. we’re not approved yet so i’m thinking of telling them i’m out. but when i saw the unit i was told i would have got the medium room and then got begged to take the small. is it fucked up if i tell them i’m out?   thinking of saying something like this  guys i literally am going t jump off the nearest bridge but i talked to my parents about the living situation and they are freaking out over the small room and don’t want to me to sign anything! i’m pissed off because we already applied to the unit and we have been going back and forth for so long, but when i saw the unit i was thinking i’d take the medium room, and thought the small was a stretch but could probably make it work. i also am sort of delusional when it comes to living in nyc, so i didn’t think anything of the small room until basically everyone i know advised me against it. i also am going to be wfh and it’s not fair to you guys to have me doing intense ass work and phone calls in the living room which would be the same spot where we would chill / eat/ pregame and all of the above. i figured i’d let you guys know bc i know it’s already super last minute but i also don’t want to entertain the idea of this unit considering conner is moving across the country literally tomorrow. now i’m in shambles and don’t know what to do but i am prob out for this unit 💀 we did find a lot nicer spots in the same budget range so idk maybe we could hold out for a tad longer but yeah i don’t think it would be smart for anyone   right ? like i’m being honest and up front. my mom is against it, my dad is for it. anyways ¿ really appreciate all the input yall are helping me think clear bro, just go to rikers, it’s free. well is anyone in here looking for a roommate ?! looking to live in manhattan budget of $1850 max the work desk could be a shelf depending on your set up. does the twin fit sideways against the back wall? then you can put a small desk in front of the window and have your hanging rack next to it.   not ideal by any means but you can make it work. consider working from a café most says the east village is full of hipster-yupee work spots id say be sure to find a gym and coffee shop nearby because its tight in there. your body will feel the restraints of the space quickly. we had a one bed one bath with enclosed porch in new rochelle for $1800. if you’re already wfh, why bother going somewhere with so little space? you’ll want some extra space if you’re going to be home at least 16 hrs a day get a loft bed 🤷🏽‍♀️ you could build your bed on a closet like 2 of those ikea closets and then put the desk below the window that looks like a barely legal 7x10 3rd bedroom dont do it side note why are you even considering this. for 1600 a month you could find something way better than that. the 20 minutes or so you’d save on a commute isn’t worth living in a shoe box it's really hard to tell the dimensions of the room, esp. the depth.  i lived in a space like this years ago but i went to the office every day and didn't need/want to do work from home.  if you don't want to build a loft, perhaps have the mattress sit on the floor (which is what i did) and during the day when you want to work, prop the mattress against the wall (put some sort of **non-slip** ""bookend"" under to keep if from sliding down) - like a poor-man's murphy bed.  then set up a sturdy card table with chair for working during the day.  i'd also see if you could negotiate down the price by a few hundred if it seems like the roommates are getting desperate and might do a deal.  do it for a year and enjoy your first year in nyc in the heart of the city and get to know what neighborhoods you might want to move to for greater space.  https://preview.redd.it/0dh0w2yjnhfd1.png?width=491&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b0523af040c5fa093d0ca985b146cb7565fdd1 if you put in a murphy bed, then yeah. nah bro if this was the only apt in the world, i’d probably do a bunk bed and move your desk underneath. the room will always look cluttered (unless you’re planning on just bringing a minimalist capsule wardrobe).  as a choice (first choice would be no), i’d only rent this room if i was just going to come back here to sleep. and with the assumption that i will be going out most nights (drinking/partying until 3am and then just going back to crash and restarting the day at 8am).  otherwise, i’d rent an apt in queens or brooklyn. cheaper and more space. working from a room where the window faces the wall (meaning it's an illegal bedroom) and gets little light, and when you have little room, will make a lot of people miserable.  it all looks rosey when you're not living in this city. vertical living. the lack of natural light will take its toll on you. omg i didn’t see the caption at first and thought this was the entire apartment. i’m in a tiny room in a similar area for similar rent and also wfh haha. the dimensions of my room r 8ft x 7ft (with closet included in that) and i’m def making it work. i’ve also lived in a wayyyy bigger apartment before and it really doesn’t feel any worse.   if u can get pictures of previous tenants and how they arranged the room, that helps a ton. also mapping out the dimensions and buying furniture that fits exactly is really helpful. i literally just drew a bunch of rectangles (1 pixel/inch) to visualize everything. i’ve managed to fit a full bed, a standing desk, a shelf, and a full-length mirror. also, get light-colored furniture, preferably white. it helps the room look way bigger and brighter. the only issue is storage, but there r a bunch of nifty solutions for that. i know everyone’s dunking on this room but unfortunately if ur looking to stay in the area, it’s just the compromise you have to make. i'd do a full or twin size loft bed if you'd wanna make this work. keep your desk under the loft and hang clothes and usually they have dresser storage. it's tight but it really matters how much you're gonna be there, is this more of a landing sleep spot? are you gonna be hanging out in common areas a lot? or are you essentially going to living full time in that space? if it's the ladder i'd suggest more space, it'll feel like jail otherwise. measuring tape is gonna help you answer this more concretely than reddit for $1600? plus a share in utilities, etc? no, please, you will be miserable. if you were paying maybe $800 for it, you could at least justify staying for a few months/year because you’d be hopefully saving money toward something better.  $1600 can get you a studio in bk, bronx, or queens. not fancy but you at least will have your own space. or a larger room somewhere else. since you also wfh part time, you don’t even have to deal with a daily work commute. i went with a broker to a place on st marks that looked like a literal jail cell. bunk beds, no room, no windows, no bathroom, no kitchen, around 1k. the place i live now sucks its a boarding house no kitchen no bathroom but with dss im paying less than 600. so small tho and its two people. it’s doable. i have a room slightly bigger than this, no closet, for $1400, and it works for me, however i do not work from home. i am in grad school so i do have a small desk/bedside table however think the set up would be really difficult if i was wfh/ not as tidy and organized as i am. did this for a year at exactly your price range. had an amazing location in williamsburg but a room this small, no closet, and a desk. kept clothes in an armoire in the living room. neighbors were noisy, cockroaches were flying by my head every night. at least i had sunlight, which you don’t. i moved out within a year. is it doable? yes. would i advise against it? absolutely. get yourself a bigger place on the l in e williamsburg. if you really have to and have no other options i’d try a nice futon in there. raise it during the day and very minimalist desk that is a terrible closet. every day you will be bitter that you are subsidizing the lessee.   some of the east village is fun to visit. but just ok to live in. but some is rough and there really isn't much to do there as a resident. a lot of apartments are dumps. public transport is not ideal. some has a lot of noise.   you could get a futon (airweave) if only sleeping there but the room will be claustrophobic. you can not do wfh in common areas. is this on avenue b? looks like my old bedroom. lol. it’s doable if so. perfect room for a computer desk, chair and a bean bag to sleep on. twin bed, small work desk, order a big unit from ikea for wardrobe storage ( 3 section one). get a plant and maybe a shoe rack and you are done. move to brooklyn and get a large bedroom and much bigger apartment for the same price. i pay the same price for a room 3x this size and a shared office in williamsburg— 15 min into manhattan from many spots in bk you’re fine i feel like it would be cheaper to enroll at a college in nyc and just live in a dorm😅 what’s the width of the space? pretty sure harry potter made it work you'll be fine is this the apartment with the spiral staircase? i lived here a couple years ago. lmk if you have any questions. i only had one other roommate so we just used this room as an office but i think after measuring it was just barely too small to fit a bed in there. get a measuring tape, get a bed dimensions, and the rooms dimensions. the picture isn't clear enough  to show how big it is. darling please go outside manhattan and be happy. i live in flatbush (prospect lefferts) in a huge 2 bedroom (converted 2nd room into storage) with the train (10 minutes into the city) only around the corner all for less than $1700/mo. my bedroom is bigger than that and i find it tiny. i have a bed, a dresser and a small bookshelf. i wouldn’t ever consider putting a desk in there and i don’t see how you can comfortably do that. sir this is a prison cell😂 for $1600??! you have lost your mind. that’s insane is your name little john i’d recommend going uptown if you’re in manhattan where bedrooms bigger than 10x10 are much easier to come by, and you may even get a tree outside your window in nyc this for sure qualifies as a 3 bedroom apartment loft bed with desk and you should be able to make it work. but i hate loft beds i had a smaller room with a double bed & tiny wfh desk. clothes were in a closet, all other belongings in under bed storage. it was cramped, but functional. definitely recommend a lofted bed & desk underneath. you'll want to maximize your vertical storage options as much as possible. shelves are a must. if your roommates are open to you taking up some space in the living room, i'd recommend keeping a shelf of personal items out there rather than your desk. it’s going to be misery loft bed. im assuming this hardware store has some decent water slide option as a closet, surely. if you got the exact measurements i could tell you from experience but for max comfortability on a twin i'd say personally out of the rooms i've had a 14×10 is amazing. i would've definitely had space for a desk if i wanted one. that depends. do you have galvanized steel and a total disregard for building codes? pee out the window. you should use some **galvanized square steel, screws borrowed from aunt, and eco-friendly wood veneers** to expand it. fill it with a lot of big black dildos only if you’re short and have a small wardrobe. i subletted an 8x6 room (with a closet taking up 3x3’ in the corner) in east village for $1575. i could only stay 2.5 months before leaving (month to month sublease). it was very challenging and uncomfortable as a 6’ male age 28. prime location, awful room. it made me really start looking for places farther out with more space. i thought being right in the heart of east village would be worth it, but in hindsight not in that room lol. maybe you can make it work short term, especially if your roommate is cool and there is a common space (i didn’t have that). geez $1600 can get you a three bedroom, 2000 sq ft house where i live (not nyc obv). deluly bunk what are the dimensions? the no closet and the window are the things that give me the greatest pause, but i think you could fit a twin and a desk no problem. the lack of light working there all day would make me sad though, it's why i ultimately left a wburg apt i loved so much, that room got no sunlight and it depressed my mood a lot.  $1600 for a room like that in ev doesn't surprise. does it make sense?? no, but it's not surprising for nyc and that area specifically. what is the rest of the apt like? do you really love the roommates? why here vs anywhere else even in manhattan? williamsburg is pricey rn but you might be able to find better there or in greenpoint, still both rly close to manhattan. even more south brooklyn could be ok too since your commute is just to midtown.  in short, you could make this work, and if there are other parts of the apt that make you really happy, it could be a tradeoff. no closet and bad light are deal breakers for me though, and i think you could do better. i had a similar issue with really small space. in nyc. i'm horrible with furniture and designs. i hired a company, lucky pearl interiors, https://luckypearlinteriors.org/  you send in room measurements and how you need room to be functional. they'll do a 3d rendering to size, give you links to exact furniture, and how to set it up. it comes with direct links where to order the furniture and price. it's inexpensive sces time, and proceeds go to their mission to redesign the home spaces of people in poor situations. i don't work for them. i just found them extremely helpful for these tiny places hell no omg i got a twin loft bed and it's the best decision i've ever made you absolutely can. if you’re worried about lighting, look into pesetech artificial light. looks incredible. can get em on amazon too!  https://a.co/d/hkdwsiu you’d be surprised! do you know the dimensions? a nearby coworking space may be worth looking into. working from here is a recipe for depression. yes that is insane.  i’ve lived in small nyc apartments but this room will get very small very quickly. looks like my first apartment in the city i have a space that’s about as small as this and while you can fit the bed and rack, you most likely can’t fit the desk. i recommend underbed storage for the clothes and then maybe you’ll be able to squeeze in a small desk is this on w 15th st? bring a tape measure or use your arm's wingspan yes it's called living like a minimalist. you can fit everything you need. not everything you want. the comments here make me so happy i am grandmothered into my apartment and only paying 1k 😭. i need to thank my landlords profusely. i’d buy some galvanized square steel and install with borrowed screws. then install some eco-friendly wood veneers murphy bed? get one of those tall bunk-bed frames that have an open space instead of a bottom bunk. put your clothes and storage under the bed, then you have space for a work desk. look up bedroom furniture for tiny apartments. i saw this on wayfair but there are many companies with options.  https://preview.redd.it/0tsiqqdj5jfd1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34baddf7c8fb2fbc8e6fd472d458a785bf0bd0fa i had a room like this. loft twin bed with desk under from ikea, and a little cube dresser. that was it! what’s the rent? as someone else said, it could possibly work with a bunk bed with a desk underneath too small murphy bed? i did it for two years. it was hell and i am not wfh. a lil delulu if you sat on the bad instead of having a chair at your desk, it could work. get a tall hollywood bedframe so you can store stuff under the bed yes and yes if the room is quiet, the location is good, and the roommates are good people... then yes. otherwise, no. nope i pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom apartment (rent stabilized) in queens ny in a good neighborhood. just for a room that price is insane . i was paying $900 when i was living in just a room. it’s totally doable. downsize that closet so you don’t have so many clothes to store. throw shit away you don’t need. you can definitely make this work. look into a few subs here on interior design — they’ll be able to help you maximise this space. dude jersey city is amazing for the budget a murphy bed with a desk might work  https://preview.redd.it/tqum8dyoijfd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67b1488e17bd693613486001e4cc921d41116e46 delulu if u want to be comfortable delulu galvanized square steel & wood veneers from aunty heck this is a closet ! i grew up in a bedroom this small. twin bed from the age of 7 to 20, one dresser, and a small vanity. obviously, i had to maneuver around my room but i did it for about 13 years so it was fine. you’re going to have to use all of the height the room has. loft the bed as high as possible and get some shelves for your clothes. get as much on the walls and as little on the floor as you can. brother nothing near that spot in ev is worth putting up with this. commuting from a lot of places around the city to get to ev if ur meeting up with somebody is rly not that hard. have a nice home (esp for wfh) and enjoy having a place to retreat to from hanging out downtown. don’t move into this if you don’t have to you’ve got this. i had an 6x10 in les. get bed raisers and a small desk. you could even mount a monitor to the wall so you dont have to get a bigger desk too. idk the dimensions but my first room was 6ft by 9ft and i made it work for a couple months until i could afford to upgrade. just did a twin bed with a desk and chair at the end, and kept my dresser right outside my door. it was terrible but also ok. you could make this space work if you had convertible furniture for everything. a murphy bed, and a pull down desk for a laptop. if you need a desktop with a monitor, then no. you can find a better deal elsewhere. and honestly you wfh. this is a “i’m never home” bedroom. at this point you'd probably be more comfortable in a literal jail cell check out stuy town you become a true nyer when you make that work!!  and if the rent is cheap and you can save $$$$ then you can get yourself a normal tiny studio all to yourself. incredible thats like a football field for ants. this is not even a walk-in closet. no that’s a closet ya'll are crazy. move to jersey, you'll still pay a bunch but at least you have space. if you plan on taking a vow of celibacy, i say go for it it could work if you have a loft bed with a desk underneath.  https://preview.redd.it/f8ze1hjrckfd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66ab2c7238f7c5a2b28e587b520fb477e8b08444 set it up like a dorm room and loft your bed with the desk underneath. on the opposite wall stuff a small clothing rack and a narrow, tall chest of drawers. this room should come with either the entryway coat closet or bathroom linen closet since the room has no closet. it’s doable. not even close to worth it for the price and location unless you had to be in manhattan i love new york and i miss it..but that damn excuse for a window is depressing now that i live in the suburbs.   the people of new york is def what kept me there for years but seeing this makes me remember why i left. 😅 platform lofted bed with desk underneath. you'll be golden you might need to pull a little john. you might need to pull a little john. delusional as a small office or closet? yes, those three things will fit in that room. try to put desk by the window btw a murphy bed might work something like this would work.   https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/home-garden/full-size-led-metal-frames-loft-bed-with-l-shaped-desk-and-wardrobe/40417249/product.html?option=82777934&recalg=1007,1006,994&recset=142bde68-c92d-4e15-9d7f-6eff29a6b59e&refccid=qwvz5zbpleyzhyshdkxj5wjqcq&recguid=076eb085-ac92-49f6-ae16-7ea2231973fa&recidx=1 wait i think i toured this exact apartment lol can’t tell the exact measurements/how much space the bed takes but you should be able to do if. twin xl along the wall with the window (the head of the bed in the corner diagonal from the wall). get bed risers and put storage underneath. put a small table and chair beside the bed (directly across from the door) to double as a nightstand and desk….hopefully you end up with at least 3-4 feet width left? look at kids size desks/vanity tables if you can’t find something small enough. depending on how much length is left in the room, you can roll a clothing rack behind the foot of the bed (to the left of the door on the same wall as door) or install a rod on the wall to use as a clothing rack if there’s no floor space. look at closet installs to find something that might work instead of a clothing rack.   my first bedroom was about this size (maybe more squared/a little wider). i had a queen size bed and a 6foot dresser. it was fine. i was 24 and really wanted to live in the east village. i had fun for 2 years and then gtfo to brooklyn where i could get more space for my money.   to make it worth it, you have to love your roommates and/or know youre going to spend a lot of time in your neighborhood/not in your tiny bedroom. but someone hang themselves in it? #newyorkcityapartmentswithfakebedrooms that’s a closet. maybe a bed, that turns in to a bench? a fold out desk? shelves to the ceiling? a lofted twin bed, with you storing your stuff on the upper loft instead of a mattress; or sleeping above and having a desk underneath. definitely. instead of a bed, sleep on a futon. roll it up after you wake up. embrace the minimalist lifestyle ive done it, definitely doable and comfortable enough as long as you dont get a desk you could maybe have an elevated bed if you want to put a desk underneath it loft the bed u can fit all that it’ll just be tight. what about  loft bed i’d say get one of those desk under bunks that’ll take care of the twin with a wfh desk. as for the close rack, explore wall units/floating shelves etc. you need more space to move. you won't be outside often. this is a bit extreme as an actual new yorker please stay tf out.  you guys move here pay ridiculous prices for tiny rooms like this and all it does is raise the rent for those who have been here their whole lives just so you can live out your ny dreams and “find yourself”. go literally anywhere else.   the fact that you needed to ask this question shows you know the answer is no. gentrification is a mf i’ve seen older folks who have lived places for decades get pushed out cause some transplant from idaho decided they wanted to pay $5000 a month for a 2 bedroom down the block so every landlord in the area follows suit.  to you it’s moving the big city to us it’s more people overcrowding an already overcrowded and under invested city. i actually don’t think you’re delusional. i fit a full bed and desk in this 6.5ft wide bedroom.  https://preview.redd.it/i76qzlth3nfd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=245b05193c6cc55f6ed62094be62c4a3f0ea8db8 i think you might need some galvanized square steel + eco friendly wood veneers why would anyone be eager to move to nyc lol it’s a shit hole lofted bed with desk underneath, dorm style. only thing i can think that would still give you space to turn around. just put a full size master chief in there and the halo theme song triggered to the door opening and green lights! and a cool pc the question is already flawed. the space is not designed properly to accommodate a real bed. maybe a lightweight cot that is foldable. the only way that space works is with items that are designed for practicality, not style. if you were to put shelves in it, they should be from a hardware store, not ikea. there aren't going to be any guarantees of comfort for a space that small. if you plan on having the entire apartment to yourself, it can work. if you are gonna have roommates and you plan on occupying it as your space, i would advise against living there. i lived in a small room that was twice that size, with a window, and being there was bad for me psychologically. you need space to move around and clear your mind enough to be productive. i say this as a new yorker, though i've never bothered to live in manhattan. bro little john would have loved this shit keep looking.  you won't be happy there.  you could just commit a minor crime and they'll give you a room that size for free.  and meals.  i grew up in nyc, albeit some time ago, but i have to believe you can do a little better with a short commute.  but if you are determined you could also out the bed on the floor and a fold down (from the wall) desk over it.  there are places you could get a hollow door for this which is light and cheap.  you could also find a significant other with a larger place which would solve the other celibacy issue you going to have. my room is about the same size as this one and i was able to fit in a twin mattress and a desk, and it has a closet, so there was no need for a clothing rack. you might be at a disadvantage though since it seems like there’s no closet in that room. you can make it work especially with that gorgeous window. everyone has to start somewhere. i feel more secure in small bedrooms for some strange reason.    also easier to keep a tidy space. time to borrow support screws from an aunt and bust out the galvanized square steel for what? it'll work as an interrogation room yeah you can definitely fit all that but it will be tight first time on this sub. why are u showing a pic of ur empty closet? how big of a closet do you really need? i’m sure you could fit your wardrobe in there no problem yo, that's a nut room! i have a similar space and ended up lofting my bed and mounting a monitor to the wall for work (still not ideal, but not as miserable as it seems) https://preview.redd.it/fqfjoh5y5pfd1.jpeg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b7c2bf35e0b21e2af263f9f519743db38c405c6 i work from home and i just have a little lap desk and sit on my bed to do work. i only need my laptop, so it works fine for me. if you need a lot of stuff for work though then yeah not sure if you’ll be able to make a whole desk work need dimensions but probably can. better yet if you can afford a fold up murphy bed with a desk under or a fold up desk.  https://kits.wallbedsbywilding.com/product/murphy-bed-with-studio-desk-kit/?attribute_size=twin&srsltid=afmbooqqbzex3oumfshi8w3bj18w3ceccswv6log0zy_ro1s42iorugs_4c  https://www.etsy.com/listing/1537104686/minimalist-wall-mounted-murphy-desk?gpla=1&gao=1& welcome to ny!!!! you are not from ny i would try brooklyn, for $1600 you can do better. manhattan is meh anyway 🥲 this is gonna be dorm room vibes at best if you do make it work just do a loft bed and you'll be fine i'd say just rent something in like edgewater, and take the ferry to nyc for work.  much cheaper. that’s literally a closet. you would need a closet in there to legally call it a bedroom. if you’re young enough, it’s worth it. one day you’ll laugh about how small your place in the city was, but how much fun you had. just make sure you’re paying rent based upon the size of the room, not splitting it three equal ways. you can definitely make it work how much is that space for ? need a roommate lol? i think it could work. glad you have s window. egress and natural light are important. if you are close to a library, wfh does not have to be in your room. spending 18 hours in that space could be crazy making loft bed with a desk or floating desk that folds back on the wall. wfh is not gonna be fun in that room i mean, you can make it happen. just a heads up two things you need to figure out as well.   1. if they allow an ac window unit in that window 2. i dont see a radiator in that room from the picture.  climate control in your room is huge in nyc. man, it gets cold in the winter and hot as hell in the summer, so those are some questions i'd ask and have atleast 2 outlets in your room.  best of luck. i hope all works out well for you. just find a place in the outer boroughs. living in manhattan is not worth it you can definitely make this space work nicely for your needs. the goal is to keep the headspace airy and open to avoid feeling cramped.  i’d recommend putting your twin xl bed towards the front left underneath the window.  bed recommendations: * twin trifold mattress could allow you to fold up when not in use giving you more space for the majority of the day. i’ve personally owned this mattress and found it supportive and comfortable https://amzn.to/3yponxp  * if you opt for a bedframe i’d recommend something simple and low profile. ikea has some great options. something like this one for example https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/neiden-bed-frame-pine-00395252/   desk and closet: i’d recommend placing your desk and closet on the back wall. the container store elfa shelving system (recommend in white) would be a great option for you to configure the a desk and closet space with baskets for office and closet storage. if you’re not interested in mounting anything to the wall they even have elfa freestanding systems that you can get. for your desk chair, this is where i’d recommend splurging on a bit, make sure it’s comfy, and beautiful, and that you love it.  the goal is to keep the space light, airy, with a light neutral color palette. i’ve lived in sf for many years in often very tiny spaces. ive owned the loft beds, murphy beds, trundle beds, pull out sofas and ultimately came to the conclusion that having large hefty furniture in a small space can feel cramped and without a lot of flexibility in the space.  the takeaways i’ve found was to use the vertical space for shelving/ closets/desks/art and keep furniture lower profile and low to the ground to keep the room open, airy, clean, and more versatile. slimming down your stuff (wardrobe included) will definitely help keep your space organized and more enjoyable to live in.  if moving to ny has been a dream of yours then go for it and make the most of it! excited for you! wayfair has [foldable desks](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=l&ai=dchcsewi38a22ltchaxuxmwgfhb-obqmyabajggjtza&ae=2&co=1&gclid=cjwkcajwnqk1bhbveiwai7o0x7othk0vupbzpbwlzrjmtap1yojcfxo4ky2x03mu_njvla04xbrkmxoc4peqavd_bwe&sph=&ohost=www.google.com&cid=caeseud2l6cgmgsh88lu8jyepqqyp4ce_gu2rjbzeepadae09cnnat8dqyjaihwobwect76fevaf-hghekeudbbowc-rx0sb4lp1crr2vplyno0djecbafrlbi3lrhjefcthqht511whhyo9yu0hhep2mfii1asraudku4v2&sig=aod64_3bu6z9hw22uzs_xvvxqvj1-2c_iw&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahukewiz46e2ltchaxu8ahkghwjjcbwqwg8oahoecacqia&adurl=) that would probably help create more space work for? easy you’ll have a room and two room mates for that share the other areas? i could make this into a closet, or a man cave where i would do karaoke. measure the room and make a rectangle with tape on the floor of wherever you currently live that's the same size as this room. try to fit your bed, desk, etc. in that tape rectangle and see how it feels. you probably could with a lofted bed but your bedroom is gonna be hot with wfh computer equipment in there and it would make me miserable trying to sleep personally. i had a huge la one bedroom with plenty of street parking for $1700 / now my girlfriend and i splitting a tiny room i think even smaller than that one in the ev to save money where the other roommate has to walk through our room to use the one bathroom - we have a bunk / loft bed where everything was underneath and we slept a top - now we moved the mattress down to the floor since it’s been so god damn hot and have to keep a path clear for the guy to walk through - we were trying to save some money and find our own spot - but im going back to la and trying to convince her to move out of nyc in general pinball machine god i remember when my studio in the east village was $1500…barely 5 years ago bro if you wfh why are you trying to live in ny so bad? move to chicago? 90% of the big city amenities at 50% of the cost sex dungeon? that room is tiny. the bed and the clothing rack maybe but adding a desk and chair would be a stretch. i’ve seen loft beds with a desk underneath, maybe that could work.  https://preview.redd.it/khqwd1n4gufd1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fcfb01b76983f5e9b6d585c258416811418114d galvanized square steel. depends on the rent. how much are you paying? and yes you can def make this space work based on if it’s a good value. that’s the size of my room hi, i have a room that is similar in size and a whole computer setup and bed. use a loft bed where the desk is at the bottom and the bed is on top. put some drawers under the desk as well and a moveable rack outside. you’ll be fine lofted bed with desk underneath build an ikea wardrobe for clothes. perfectly fine as a starting point, i shared a space that size with a roommate in college use some galvanized square steel i'll never understand people wanting to move to nyc. that being said, yea you can definitely make that space work the comments seem agreed that you'd have to do a lofted bed. so then the question becomes are you going to want to ever have sex little john i mean leslie made it work on ted lasso are there any air vents in that room? i understand you want to be “where it’s happening” but if i were you and with that budget, i’d move to brooklyn/queens/the bx. i’m in staten island tho so you really can’t ask me, you couldn’t pay me to go out like, ever, so living in a spot just because it’s good to go out at doesn’t appeal to me.   well i guess you could pay me. but i’d complain the whole time. this is nyc, it’s a goldmine something like this would be awesome  https://preview.redd.it/gwi68w2d2wfd1.jpeg?width=1021&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89d41c84673a1d1777108d9ad096bfea213a95f1 i had a flex room (only 2 real walls) for about 2 years and worked from home in the tiny room. it was small but ok. 1 year was fine but the second tested my patience. do you need good credit to get a room like that? lmao i think i toured this exact room. you *can* make it work but if it is the room im thinking it is, it isnt worth the $1k price tag. $850 max i had a similar setup i had a rack, twin bed and desk. it’s a tight fit but it worked. you do not have a lot of space and you can only invite 1 person in your rooms. on the bright side ac and heat will not be an issue since a small ac or heater can really do it for you,   you can’t eat or leave laundry for too long, it will cause your whole room to smell. wats the price?? i read this as “work space” and i thought, yeah, it could fit a desk but not much else 😅 as someone from nyc, don’t do it… don’t fall for itty bitty expensive apartments in the “city” look for an apartment out in queens, washington heights, or the bronx. the bronx sounds scary and it looks the part a bit, but once you get used to it, it’s homey. lived in the bronx most of my life. 1600 to live in a box is crazy ask that dude on youtube. double check the measurements on the bedframe, clothing rack, and desk you're thinking of buying or already have, then plug into https://www.planyourroom.com to ensure the math checks out 👍🏻 no. you’ll just spend money making it work then moving. and rents will go up. find a better place to live that’s a closet. what exactly are you planning to do in there ? you can definitely answer this question without the help of reddit. look at the size of that room... get yourself some galvanized square steel and eco friendly wood veneers a loft bed would work. bedroom with workspace underneath expand w galvanized steel there are 1700 studios in astoria. astoria is 20 min from midtown i think your apprehension is a good signal this is not a good idea a bit of both. delusional for thinking about making it work. ….for like the whole place. no kitchen? bathroom!?!? man i would die in a city. i wouldn't. if you work from home, you're going to spend a lot of time in a 6-foot by 8-foot cell. if you had a job in soho and you wanted to minimize travel time and time spent in your apt, i'd say go for it, but your going to be spending 80+ hours a week in that tiny room. fuck that noise. get some shelves and hanging rods. this is a decent closet. air storage. omg! that’s my old room in my old apartment. i’ll pm you pics of how i set it up but it’s definitely doable (with a full size bed) rent it to a massage therapist, and have them give you free massage barter system rent if the rent and neighborhood are good i say go for it. ikea has a cheap loft bed 👍🏻. but if the neighborhood is shit or other factors are off then yeah you could probably do better. basically if the only “con” is size then make it work. for my first apt in nyc i was basically looking for 2 out of 3 in terms of price/neighborhood/apt itself and i went with price/neighborhood and lived in a semi shithole and it was a great first apt in nyc experience. why do people want to live in nyc this bad?😭 bro is gonna need eco friendly wood veneers and galvanized square steel get a murphy bed. you’ll then have enough room for a workspace. consider living in bk or queens. just take a step back and think about spending all day in a tiny cramped room with a view of a wall.   wfh from a shared space seems like a recipe for trouble. why put yourself through extra stress?

6,[advice] did I get a good deal for this 1 BR in the east village at $2800?,"literally all 1 bedrooms for less than 3k is a “steal” nowadays absolutely! i had to give up my studio apt on e 10th st after 10 years bc my rent went from $2850 to $3700! looks nice ! big ups if thats a dish washer i see there hey i’m also looking to move and wondering how you found the spot, was it on streeteasy? curious question how much was the brokers fee any 1-bedroom downtown that nice is a steal for $2800 yes are there more pictures that everyone but me is seeing??? all i see is half a living room with absolutely no way to tell how small it is, never mind the rest of the apartment that actually looks pretty decent sized, the kitchen is nice, and you have a ceiling fan and i think we have the same wireless keyboard i'm typing on right now lol  i just rented a $2750 not too far away, so i think you did pretty good! it's slightly better than average. 100% rent stabilized? this was a good deal on 2018 wow i lived on st marks across from the physical graffiti building in 2005 and paid $1350 for 400 sq feet. taking all into account, i say yes that is a good deal. i mean for manhattan…but 1bdrms shouldn’t be almost 3k. ll scum suck. congrats tho considering the location, yeah it's pretty good. 1bed!? east village!? 2800!!!??? and not a complete dump of an apartment space!?? abso-fucking-lutely you lucky lil shit. i hate that we’ve been brainwashed as a society to think that $2800 is a “steal” for a one bedroom apartment. is it cheaper than other places in the area? sure, probably. but it’s gross how we’ve just accepted this as the norm. i thought this was rochester, ny for a moment, and nearly shat myself. original comment said wow congrats what a steal.     but where in east village really matters.  if it's on 13th and 2nd, wow amazing! (doubt it).  but if it's like avenue c or avenue d and 6th, you couldn't pay me to live there why ask now 😂 after you already moved in 😂 how’s the lights and window view looks like? yes, except for that ghost in the bathroom ceiling which may explain the price. little bit of sage and holy water should take care of that. congrats! that a pretty dope apartment bro getting on here to brag huh! 😩 what advice are you looking for? you signed, paid deposit, first month’s rent, and brokers fee, and moved in.   what advice are you looking for? absolute steal. don’t let the non nyers see this though they’ll be yelling at u saying u can rent a whole house in wherever bumblefuck they live for that price lmao where do you work to be able to afford this kind of rent? depends on the avenue heck yeah it’s a good deal as long as you make sure you never get in an accident that requires you to use a wheelchair, preventing you from walking up all those flights of stairs to get to your home! sure… the time to be there was the 1980's.  not too much left after gentrification, covid and the loss of the galleries.  but hey, enjoy it if you can afford it.  just watch out for the rats. it could be an illegal apartment if you got it for that price. but i could be wrong of course. https://youtu.be/mhgb12-hipq?si=jfbejrpr6keoptyu is there any broker fee? if so, how much. are utilities included? not too good of a deal.  somebody left some video games posters on the wall. unpopular opinion, but i think you're getting ripped off. so glad i opted to not live in the city. lower east side. you live in the lower east side. stop pretending like you don’t. you’re contributing to the erasure of this neighborhood 😍 wasting your money tbh no you got clowned, everybody’s getting clowned.  rent should never be this high for a 1br [removed] [removed] $2800 is a ridiculous amount of money to piss away on rent every month, but hey, that's the ridiculously expensive city these days. i'm glad i bought when this city was still affordable. i feel for those just starting out. [removed] looks nice. i love the poster's yes. rent-stabilized , yes. absolutely you did amazing imo for east village. depends on the building if you can't afford to pay the electric bill, then maybe not. on another comment i saw that brokers fees were only 1 month, not bad at all. that’s a great find for the price! nice! that’s what i paid in brooklyn for a 2 beds, but to be in east village, it’s a good deal, also very spacious, get ready for gta 6 ur poster game is solid ya sure did kid yessss!!! yes yes for sure. had a studio on 10th between 1st and 2nd for $2300 that was about the size of what is visible here. yes this is a good deal yes 100% how big is it? love the setup. minimalist, yet stylish. check street easy.  likely a reasonable price.  does the bldg have washer/dryer?  how is management if there’s an issue?  and what kind of yoy increases can you expect?  i’d also check openigloo for the landlord reviews.  might be worth requesting rent history from the city now to get a better sense of whether it likely should be rent controlled or stabilized - and if so, you are treated as such. i use to smoke weed there. def not a good deal yes! i went to a seance and used a ouija board here. god dam it’s expensive to live back home this is great!!  welcome to the neighborhood :) absolutely it’s a great deal r/malelivingspace      anyway, nice. studios and 1 bedrooms more than 3000…? damn and i thought toronto rent market is disappointing what amenities does the building your living in have?  do you have a washer/dryer in your apt? that’s awesome! congrats! yeah, sounds like a good deal! i lived in midtown east (by the un) last year in a 1bed for $2550/mo. 6th floor walkup and no laundry in the building lol. but the apartment itself looked as nice as yours. the area is not as good as ev obviously too so i think you did well yess wtf oh yeah definitely a steal tbh can you show us more pics? looks awesome does it have a window? dope setup 🤞🏾 dude yes no. that’s a great hood! check out horseshoe bar on 7th and ave b maybe u payin for the neighborhood. my apt looks along the lines of this. and am paying less. but if u happy then w yes!! nice flex if there aren’t any rodents crawling around then yes! ave a isn’t above tompkins 👀👀👀 nice deal bro!!! this is pretty great. it's a god damn shame, but yes it's a good deal in today's market. a god damn shame. i’m an agent, yes you did, a stunning deal. i pay 1200 for a whole house this is insane 😭 yes you did that ain’t no damn deal. 2800 a month for a 1 bedroom is insane! why are you willing to pay so much for a building that doesn’t even have an elevator 2800 is definitely ""cheap"" for the area. looks like you got a nice place too. you got a great deal 2800 wtf believe it or not, yes. hook me up. you got an amazing deal. you would never have been able to get that price in the spring summer when it turns into a feeding frenzy. need to see how the rest of the apt looks like including the bedroom and maybe restroom, storage etc. east village is not a high pricing area in manhattan relatively. i could see that the living room doesn’t have official dining area can’t tell from just that photos but it’s a nice price for that location so consider it a score! you did good. easy walk to the f train. lots of good eating and drinking in the neighborhood lol in california i can find this for 1700-2100 rent near tompkins square park: $2,800  being able to wake up, stumble out of bed, and in 5 minutes get to tompkins square bagels to grab a french toast bagel with birthday cake cream cheese before they sell out: priceless bruh thats my mortgage in new rochelle for a 4 bedroom house jesus i use my dishwasher to keep my things to be recycled. great storage space... current average for rent in nyc is approx $3500! it's a steal! i absolutely love those movie posters on the wall. you've got incredible taste. without knowing any of the details it looks like a complete steal. now you live in the old apartment and pay 36000$ per year. now ask yourself is that how much you want to spend for just having roof above your head? is commute bothering you so much that you feel like you need to stay in manhattan for work or study or what ever ?   it is beyond any reason to pay so much for old apartment unless it is absolutely necessary. you can live in forest hills queens like a king for this money and ride a 15 min railroad train to penn station when needed. if you got a view of tompkin square park - yes! but there are some problems. you're on the top floor (in the summer the sun look the roof, so your apartment is hotter.2. when they're is a leak, it's going to be directly on you.  if it's a sunny apartment then that's a big plus! i've worked in nyc real estate, and rent increases are out of this world. to be honest, i haven't seen 'good deals' in a long time. landlords squeeze tenants for every penny they can. is good if they didn’t charge you for water aka trap dishwasher and electricity but is all about location lol this is actually a lovely apartment! decent feel like you could’ve got a better deal yes these days….yes, not terrible yeah that's not bad at all for a 1 bedroom a 1bdrm in manhattan under $3k is certainly a steal! it’s sad that’s a reality. the ceiling fan is a huge plus! full sized fridge and an actual stove in manhattan is rare too.. how long ago was it renovated i live in east village and work in real estate",756,191,positive,0.3933526873588562,947,i think you got apartment in the east village. i think you got apartment. you got apartment. i think you got i think it's a steal. 100% rent stabilized? i think?? i think i think was a good deal i think? is yes but if it’s but but i think.
7,I’m cooked,"guest fee is wild the guest fee doesn't sound legal. if they stay more than 4 hours? there's a lot of reasons someone would be at your apartment for more than 4 hours during the day...   pretty unhinged. not sure how it's enforced. if it *is* enforced you might be dealing with a crazy person. not a lawyer, but a lot of this is not legal/enforceable. #5, #6, #14 for example.  edit because i'm getting a lot of replies: op being essentially a sublessee was not included in their original post, which changes the situation significantly. however, i maintain that were a lot of these restrictions articulated in a tenant-landlord lease, they'd likely be unenforceable. for instance, when legislation was updated in 2019 the government *really* tried to shore up rights and responsibilities related to breaking a lease; given 227-e's assertion that any lease provision that exempts a landlord from their duty to mitigate is void as contrary to public policy, i can't imagine a situation in which a tenant's failure to pay a leasebreak fee as articulated in a lease would legally entitle a landlord to shirk their duty to mitigate. this is the first time i've ever seen ""no plants"" nal, but i don't believe 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 (plants)  and 17 are legal or enforceable. however, a lot depends on what type of housing you're in: market rate, a building with less than i believe four units (please check me on this), rent regulated. my lease has a “no subletting/no lease transfers” clause and a “you’re only allowed to use box window ac units instead of the portable tube ac units” clause (they said it’s to avoid water damage from ac units leaking), so really specific rules can be normal, but these are *really* weird.   it sounds like the landlord wants to run a dorm with these types of rules. no *plants???* almost none of these terms can be enforced. never pay the landlord any of these stupid fees. just pay your rent. if you pay cash get receipts this is obviously not a landlord (the language is a joke, even for a small inexperienced landlord) but the person seeking the roommate and has went through / read way too many nightmare stories on reddit    on one hand it’s probably a pretty chill apartment but honestly the roommate is basically looking for someone with 0 social or romantic life or that keeps all of that out of the apartment. they’re basically trying to feel like they’re living as close to alone as possible   i would tell them to f off and leave, arguing about legalities is probably going to be ugly (because unlike a landlord this person is right outside your door when you sleep) this is bait lmao not normal at all. f$&k this landlord run no drinking in a lease is wild lol. is the landlord your mom? not normal, you can not dating if you dating you must pay 30$😁 per night, you must fasting from social life for 1 year cont;; i rented this room from a facebook marketplace, i’m a student and i do not have a guarantor so it was extremely hard for me to get a room bc most of them ask for income or guarantors. this landlord only asked me my bank statements and one month deposit. that’s the reason why i decided to move there. but i was so damn dumb to not ask for other lease conditions. i only found out abt these when i moved in and signed the lease. my stuffs are already in the room and i already paid one month deposit so it was too late to go back. anyway lesson learnt, i’ll just think of this on the bright side, this is going to be one productive year for me lol this is definitely not legal- were you not shown this until after you signed….? definitely not standard. the one that stands out for me is 12. the landlord is responsible for keeping the place in habitable condition not the tenant. the guest one too, if they’re quiet and there are no issues with sound i don’t think that is enforceable, tenants have the right to privacy & quiet enjoyment. its a bit much but they probably did it to cover their end in case something happens. my apartment has some strict rules too, but they don't really enforce it. the guest fee is kinda extreme and hard to keep track of unless... they have like sign-in/sign-out sheets for the guests.   no drinking? that's lame.   also if your utility included in the rent? weird they ask you to turn off the lights. lmaooooo my friend had a visitor fee in her contract which she didn’t know about. until 3 months into living there they sent her a fee for 21 nights for me and our third having slept over. apparently her landlord had a ring camera up to record every time someone came over which is wild. she ended up having to an extra $2100 due to this. then they evicted her🥴 whoa. this is wild on many levels. fuck that shit. i think point number 7 might be illegal.  consult a lawyer but really, i’d just move on. how would they enforce the rule of not having a plant lol what does he have against plants? nah this isn’t normal, beloved this has more rules than actual jail a lot of these provisions are illegal in nys and nyc. the emphasis on leaks and plumbing is so concerning. not sure if it’s too late but if possible i would have landlord do a plumbing & electrical inspection (all parties present) before agreeing to these terms. no. the leaseholder is high on paste. don't sign. move out tomorrow if you can. this is an unconscionable contract eh they gonna control when you get visits. as if you were in jail or something…. ngl if i’m paying x amount of money and making up the rent every month on time i’m doing whatever tf i want in my space if they don’t like it sue me and they better have good lawyers lol if this is real, do yourself a huge favor and just don’t live here. if you’re already living there, back out of it now before you’re there too long. the person you’re subleasing the room from is a petty, pedantic little dictator, and this is just the top of the iceberg. whether you follow these rules or not, they’re going to make living there absolutely miserable lol alot of places say no smoking,  but no drinking and guest fee is wild. sounds like a hotel room more then a apartment. move out, they are mentally ill. it is not worth it to rent rooms from crazy people out of desperation. i am speaking from experience. you’ll find another place with more reasonable terms. better to have a reasonably normal social life at your age than to live in a pristine dungeon. you are not their insurance company. no. certainly there are some things that might seem weird but make sense once the ll explains it-like no candles-but this is goofy. a friend had rules like this in a halfway house type sro. no drinking is a new one for sure 7) not legal, you get 5 days grace in nyc  11) not legal, they can’t prevent gatherings because they can’t prevent guests. they can definitely ban smoking though, and obviously if you’re disrupting others they can take issue. can’t find any reason they can’t ban drinking except that it’s obviously normal usage of the premises, good luck to your landlord if they take you to court for that.  12) not legal in the case the issue is not your fault  14) not legal, landlord cannot restrict guests. also, you can have a partner move in with you and they can’t stop that either the guest fee is a joke ahhahahaha no plants??? actually it makes a lot of sense now that i know you’re renting a room and not an apartment. like a lot more sense. why no drinking? is it a halfway house? the partying rule 😂 most of this is just scare tactics landlords do to young people who don't know tenant rights. most of it won't be enforced by the landlord btb no plants??? it’s definitely a lot but looks like they’ve been burned in the past and trying to prevent it again. a lot of bad legal advice in this sub if this wasn’t in your lease you signed it’s not enforceable. some of it simply isn’t enforceable in general lol do you live with your parents? this is insane but, what about the leaks? are leaks ok? no plants?……. whoever this is does not gaf about human beings no plants? ok ok i guess i can understand the ""no pets"" ""no drugs"" ""no partying"" but no plants??? aw hell no screw you this is not normal at all 8k in broker fees, over priced rent for ghetto neighborhoods and landlords have the nerve to have these many rules it’s infuriating. this is ridiculous yes why did you sign this…. what kind of shit lease is this 😂 this hardly looks like a lease to me. the language isn’t very dense. theres no difficult-to-read landlord jargon or legal either. are these listed in the actual lease that you signed? like you signed a document with these words on them? or did you sign a lease beforehand and then get handed this list of rules? we had less strict rules in military training sir, is this jail? why'd you even bother? you renting in a church? tf.. as soon as some says ""cash only"" legitimacy goes out the window some of these provisions are not legal.   you can’t be required to pay in cash.   there are provisions about breaking a lease - if you find someone to take over your lease they can’t charge you.   report this landlord to 311. what did the plants do to this person hahaha ny state law mandates a 5 day grace period on rent due date so the last day of month and $10 per day is unenforceable many of those provisions are illegal.  bring that document to an attorney. why would you agree to any of this? no plants??? i’d rather buy a shitty car and live in that than live under those rules. aa¹ yes this sounds appropriate most of this is illegal lol if you sign this piece of paper, you're basically signing up to fuck yourself in a year. no one who hands this out is giving you your security deposit back without a fight. no this is not normal. move out. has to be satire no is not, a license realtor will tell you no, you can also look up the department housing in your country. but must laws regulate the same lmao you have to pay $30 to get laid damn no plants?? pretty sure most of these are illegal and can’t be enforced in nyc. look into your rights as a tenant. is this an apartment in someones house? like if i want to drink im gonna drink, landlord can eat a fat one i'm super curious, doesn't 14 violate federal law? that's saying you can't have a nurse, home health aide, even your kid seeing you.   then, they're 3 lines in regards to leaks. tenant doesn't control the pipes, how do you know everything is solid? less than 4 hours means return of the king extended edition is out the window i guess you’ll have to go with the theatrical cut wow very strict!!! does seen like a lease for a room for rent. think about how many times the “landlord” had to be burned to come up with these rules. not normal, do not sign. the dude that made this, is his name rob by any chance? you signed something agreeing to these?   or, you signed something and then they gave you these?   very big distinction. is this 90 washington? i lived there for a year and the management company was horrendous!! that is not a normal lease contract lmao find a new place to live wtf ajajajajaj you’re paying if you clog the toilet or sink? gtfo of there asap no plants?! that’s very odd lol something tells me they have a leak issue.. nyc tenant rights - https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/tenants_rights.pdf it's sad but someone will rent this unit under these ridiculous terms. are you a boarder in a rooming house? or is this an actual your own bedroom bathroom and kitchen apartment? because none of that crap is in a standard lease that you would find online even. landlords cannot oblige you to pay for repairs when they are responsible for maintaining the apt in @ habitable” condition what is 1-3? nooooo.  don’t agree to this.  ridiculous. bruh plant some trees in some pots. there isn't a ""no tree"" rule. 😂. when landlords make ridiculous rules, be even more ridiculous. by any chance are you moving into an apt with landlord below you… on putnam ave?? 14 is ridiculous, your paying rent , your have a right to have guests. a lot of those rules, as others have stated, aren’t legally enforceable. leave asap my experience living with a lawyer is that contracts are way more complicated legally than you’d think. it might be worth finding someone (professional!) to ask questions to. half the rules are unenforceable, in least offensive way your landlord is probably an orthodox jew because of the obvious religious viewpoint for drinking rules no plants??? strike out 14 and sign it. don’t say anything. if he catches you just say ya i’m not agreeing 14 and 18 are weird.  (i can understand no pets but the plants is a weird request).  it seems pretty straightforward since you are renting from the lease holder and not landlord management company - is this correct?  i would speak to the lease holder on #14 and 18.  14 - how would they check that you don't have an overnight guest?  will they open your door and check closets, under your bed, under the sheets, etc?  7 - please request a change for it to align with your payroll schedule.  what happens during federal holidays, etc?  why cash?  request for check or zelle so you have documentation.     12 - since this is a shared bathroom, how will blame be determined? no plants? there’s no way nyc laws would allow any of this nonsense to be enforceable omg. the person who typed that up needs to get laid jesus mary of josephine. i don't don't ll/t work, but lots of the terms of this are unenforceable and / or illegal legalities aside: i hope the rent is really cheap, that’s an amazing room & you spend 96% of your time outside the apartment because…the person you’re renting from sounds like an actual demon. lol that’s a bunch of bs i hate nyc apartment hunting. no plants?! 🤣 wow, seems like they always have issues with leaks for it to be mentioned twice on the agreement lol who would sign this? hahahah yeah ok hahahahha ny broker here. no. none of this is. simply reply saying you’d like to use a standard rebny rental lease. easy to find online. and is attorney reviewed to protect you both. why is payment of rent in cash? is this landlord not paying taxes?  first, how are you dropping the cash.  second, how would you get a receipt saying you paid? paging my lawyer to find out whether the supreme court has ruled on what constitutes “partying”, and whether a nyc landlord has ever successfully enforced a “no drinking” clause in a lease.  anyway i want to emphasize that tenant law is so absurdly biased towards tenants in nyc that you could probably blow through all of these and still get the judge to rule in your favor after a 12 month eviction process. to me, the bigger red flag is that this is telling you how the landlord will conduct himself - if your heat gets fucked over the weekend, don’t expect it to get unfucked earlier than tuesday morning. this level of contempt for tenants usually goes hand in hand with, well, contempt for tenants. no drinking?? a guest fee? that seems nuts several of these provisions are illegal. get fucked  - tenant lol it’s nyc. they are very heavily pro tenant - unreasonably so. you can do what you want then stop paying rent and you’ll be there free for months. that said it’s insane you agreed to this even though some of it is brazenly unenforceable. no drinking for example. whoa... those terms are quite draconian. first off, was this room rented to you directly by the landlord or through the current tenants? regardless, some of these conditions are definitely eyebrow-raising. did you discuss these terms beforehand, or were they presented to you after you signed the lease?  you may not be fully cooked: if any of these ridiculous stipulations conflict with public policy or state law, its not enforceable. just to be clear, i'm not a lawyer, and this isn't legal advice—it's always best to consult with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction. blah blah blah however, i write letters to c-suites and have had some so orders in my favor on some consumer issues.   looking at a few of these clauses, these people are out of their rabbit minds:  * **#7 (pay next month’s rent by the last day of the month in cash +$10 per day for late fee)**: this isn't enforceable as written, at least not in nyc. new york city gives tenants a 5-day grace period before late fees can be assessed, and those fees are capped at either $50 or 5% of the monthly rent, whichever is lower. * **#12 (tenants pay for stuck toilets and sinks)**: this clause is vague. what exactly does ""stuck"" mean? if a toilet malfunctions because of something you did—like flushing wads of bounty or huggies—you might be responsible. but if it’s a regular malfunction, the landlord is typically obligated to fix it due to the implied warranty of habitability.  it seems like the landlord might be frustrated due to issues with past tenants, but that doesn’t absolve them of their legal responsibilities. sometimes, landlords throw in these kinds of provisions, hoping tenants won’t challenge them. if any disputes arise, make sure to question the ones that don't seem normal before handing over any money.  if you were shown these terms only after signing the lease, you might want to contest their validity. a contract requires a ""meeting of the minds"" to be binding, and these provisions would have influenced your decision to enter into the lease. also, the document looks hastily put together—definitely not something you’d expect from a professional lease agreement. i can't see the entire page in your picture, but i don't see any signatures or initials either proving you were in receipt of it.   good luck! no plants? no deal. is this the original lease from the landlord or what your roommate is presenting you as a roommate agreement? start here for an understanding of your rights as a tenant. https://home.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page#:~:text=in%20new%20york%20city%2c%20tenants,tenants%20from%20harassment%20and%20discrimination and https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/  also do not listen to the legal advice re: enforceability of a lease from anyone who is not an nyc tenant lawyer or advocate (it is a very specific niche). as a rule of thumb in nyc, you cannot sign away your rights as a tenant, even if your lease says otherwise can you breathe? 14 is insane no plants!? 😂 also no “drinking.” double 😂 ""no plants""   yeah you can f*ck right off with that man. i'm paying you rent and you're saying i can't have a desk plant or some shit? what kind of power trip is this person on? like honestly go die in a fire. yikes. this is illegal why do you mean rented?  you didn’t read this first? and why is it their fault if you end up still signing and agreeing to it anyway??? no, that’s not normal. if you’re paying for the electric bill, you should be able to have whatever lights on. the guests you have over.. sounds like a fraud. you should be able to have whoever you want over since you are paying to live there. if your toilet or sink is clogged, use a snake or plunger even in the sink- works wonders. take pictures of things that are messed up and email them to your landlord so that they don’t try to charge that before you leave. i would document so much if i lived there. pets, i understand but plants?!?!? like it’s a plant!!! these rules gave me secondhand rage no plants? lol that's wild no plants? no plants 🤣 anne frank had easier living conditions/rules is allowing a lease transfer legally required? i want to transfer apt to my friend and move in with my gf. landlord doesn't want to give me that option is this not a joke….? whose your landlord? hitler? what kinda shit is this i work in property management currently and i have a jd. so not an attorney but i have housing background from my current job & i did ll/tenant law prior to this job.   i can’t speak on ny law too much but i know with certainty a lot of these are common in most leases. i know this is a private ll but most multifamily apts and property management companies use the same lease basically.   11 & 14 are the two weirdest things in there. everything else is pretty normal imo. not the most professional lease but the point is there lol i would not touch this lease with a 100ft pole!! absolutely not! neeexxxt. just look up ny landlord tenant laws. a landlord can’t enforce anything that goes against those.  [here u go](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants_rights.pdf) no plants?! lmao poor soul is this a college dorm lol wait until they hit ya with an 11% rent increase the following year if you want to resign with these scumcucks run like the wind, nothing but problems there landlords are like this because people tend to be trashy. are you sure this is not a hostel??? drinking is forbidden!!! lol simply never pay any of these fees and tell ‘em to take you to court over 50$ if they rlly want to no and this is illegal don't live there. this is giving you an example of the kind of landlord they will be, and it doesn't seem pleasant. who charges for visitors or doesn't allow plants?! or drinking? if i want to drink in the home i'm paying for, then i'll drink, dammit. what a psychopath. next this is why i don’t do rooms anymore. ridiculous. much better living paycheck to paycheck in my own apartment. so i cant have people in my house that i pay rent for? eat a dick 😂 wtf, no plants?!!! now define ""partying"" lmao guest fee not a lawyer but lawyer adjacent and a tenant. my bf owns some apts he leases too.   question: does your landlord own the building or the apartment? i feel like this would at least make the stricter rules make more sense if it’s the apt only? i just have an inclination this person only owns this apt, is maybe a bit older (judging from this whole situation but also the appearance and overall read of this word doc) and they have clearly gotten screwed over before.   5 - depends. are you the original lease holder?  6 - should be that months rent + fee = 1 month of rent. the deposit is separate and has nothing to do with this…that’s the whole thing about deposits. they’re only for damage and technically the landlord should be holding those in a separate account/at least always have that on hand (ie. they cannot presume you will not get it back…slimy). you also can’t use the deposit for your last rent and they are allowed 15 days to return it to you (reasonable duration to determine repairs $)  7 - i think you should have 5 days before fees. some peoples checks take a min to clear?? get real.   10 - i think it’s 1 month.   14 - a guest fee?? how many awful bfs and gfs has this apt had?? this one is very crazy and points to a specific situation happening in the past one or more times. 😂  the rest seems normal. but i don’t really trust someone who can’t make a proper list with normal indentations. they seem unhinged to me lol.  they sound pissed and tired of being a landlord. they should just sell😗 too many rules ooof they must have faulty pipes. no drinking, no plants, and give me $30 if you get laid 😭 landlords like this talk big game but mean nothing. what you do is be very accommodating and polite to these guys, they’ll let anything slide as long as you’re not an asshole about it. no pets or plants lmao what dont rent rooms, they put crazy rules and they can kick you out whenever. little tip though, what they’re doing is illegal so if they’re ever too much a problem, you can report them and they will lose the apartment. are you renting a room or you have a whole apt ![gif](giphy|3rgxbxquqtfmm5mdc8) what city is this in? more likely this won't hold in court and is borderline illegal. no plants? yes is normal. are they going to stand in front of your apartment to make sure it has not been more than 4 hours since a guest has been over? lol move out never, ever pay rent in cash. ever. what the fuck leave….like right now bro, just go back home and live with your parents at this point. no plants?! some are a little irrational, but i've seen worse. what bothers me is the...no drinking. if you want a beer or wine with your dinner, go ahead and tell him to f*** off. i'm looking for an apt also. does he got more room's. please tell. good luck this seems like trolling lmfao this is fake. you printed this out for upvotes so cringe",716,313,negative,0.7086743712425232,1029,"i think it's enforceable. the landlord is a sublessee, so they don't enforce it. my landlord is a sublessee, so they enforce it. my landlord enforces it. my landlord enforces it. my landlord enforces it. my landlord enforces it. my landlord enforces it. my landlord enforces it."
8,Would I be stupid to leave a $860 rent stabilized studio apartment?,"everyone is different so make the best choice for yourself.    regarding many people's opinion: don't do it. living in an affordable apt in your location rarely happens. ask her to move in, and split the rent. you will save for the future. you will have way more options doing this.    also, you and your gf might not make it. if that happens, at least you get to keep your apt. give it to me please i don’t want to say you would be *stupid* to leave, because your reasons for looking for a new/bigger place do make sense on paper, but your reasons for staying make *much more* sense. namely the fucking **$860 luxury studio** you’re thinking of leaving, lol. and rent stabilized!!! with in-unit laundry 😭😭 i would never leave unless i had kids or something and literally needed the extra space. and even then it would be heart-wrenching. don’t leave.  you’d be hard pressed to find anything decent for under 2k.  y’all need to make that studio work for the nxt 5 years while saving vigorously.  might also be worthwhile to enter lotteries for something larger meanwhile.  don’t let feelings override reason.  i’d like to put my name in the ring in the event you do decide to leave regardless.   you need to sell to you partner  the thousands you save by being a bit more patient.  anything short of a baby is not a good reason toleave.  edit:  i missed the in unit laundry— yea personally i’d never leave.  even if i had a kid we are finding a way to make that work 🤪 for the first several years. gf temporary rent stabilized is forever curious what street? can i pretend to be your girlfriend and pay you rent and you can move out. i am nice and normal and due to my last post i’m now looking for a new place in the city. yes you should not leave this apartment. don’t leave, too much opportunity for saving money while you’re in it. don’t leave tbh. your gf can deal with the smaller space. the cost of a semi-decent apartment is out of control and chances of it being rent controlled are slim to none bc they’re so competitive. it’s hard to even grasp paying that little rent… i’m not sure i’d ever leave unless i decided to buy a place. the relationship part certainly makes it more complicated. you have a $860 luxury studio in upper manhattan. that alone is a don’t leave. yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everyone will have a different opinion, but do not leave   save for a down payment  i’m not being a cynic, but gf’s come and go (i’ve bought a place with one), cheap apartments in luxury buildings in nyc do not you will become bitter if you pay 2x-3x more if you’re shouldering most of the cost i have a friend who won a stabilized apartment lottery, on 40th floor of lux bldg, paying about this amount....in great area.... you don’t know if this relationship will last long term, youre talking about her moving in with you in a year or two, it’s not something you need to worry about right now.   when you come to a point where you want to move in with someone, you can always get a storage unit to offset the space issue, it’s still cheaper than leaving the apartment. a lot of people break up once they move in so until you get married and have a kid, i don’t think you should move. or if you start making crazy money. you would be incredibly dumb as you wouldn't be able to get anything like this at market rates for under 3k. don't move. man even if i got married i would just live separately. yes you would be insane this is more of a relationship question vs a question on the apartment tbh. in a few years, the market can be completely different, you and your girlfriends values different, etc. the one which will always remain, nyc demand > supply, especially for affordable (and even rarer, rent stabilized) places.     short answer, yes you'd be stupid and crazy to leave that for all the reasons folks have put below. it may be worth it to look at what that same studio would go for without the rent stabilization, calculate financially what that would mean for just you (with your assumptions about splitting), and go from there. with rent that low there is no need to ever buy. just keep saving your money and when you tire of nyc or want to retire you will have stacks of cash to make that happen. you have all the advantages of owning already, with none of the hassles at a fraction of the cost. don't move. pls give it to me keep it add her into your housing connect profile and apply for larger apts through the lottery. it won’t be this cheap though . do the math and lay it all out for your girlfriend. calculate your combined likely income for the next five years. then do the math on much you will be able to save each month for a down payment paying $860 a month vs. $3000 (or whatever rent would be your max). laying out that you would be able to have (for example) a $250k down payment vs. a $100k down payment to eventually purchase a place might help her (and you) understand the value of staying in the rent-stabilized place for a while. convince her of the value of keeping it and get a bigger weekend place upstate or in the poconos. at that price you’re sitting on a goldmine. go to the youtube channel called “never too small.”  there are multiple small, urban apartments that have incorporated space saving ideas and furniture that you would never know existed.  good luck - and i don’t think you should move. what about renting work space? so it keeps work and home separate and have separate alone space? and you can stop the work space rental anytime, but you will never get another rent stabilized apartment at this rate how long have you been with this girlfriend? can you give it to me? please. i will take it. is this a humble brag, or you trying to start a bidding war. because in the right situation you probably could get several thousand. yeah i think it's stupid. subsidized apt. are rarer than girlfriend for a working man with a dick. less rare than wives. imagine you give up this apt and you brake up. boo hooo for u. make it work in the studio or leave it alone. even if u get a bigger apt. $3k plus broker fees, deposit, and moving cost vs $860. a month rent. even half it's almost double your rent.🤔 keep that place. you're unlikely to find an apt like this again. you don't know if this relationship will last i’ll volunteer as tribute 🙋🏽‍♀️ don’t do it. i wouldn’t give up an apartment with that rent for anyone. lol. you're missing the obvious solution.  get a new, more spacious apartment with your girlfriend, but keep this one - at least for 6-12 months or so.  if your combined income is going to be increasing so much, you should be able to swing it in the short term.  the studio apartment you are describing is worth its weight in....i don't know, what's more valuable than gold?  platinum?  vibranium??  sounds like your g/f is not from nyc, or hasn't been here long, and so she maybe doesn't understand this.  an nyc housing lottery is just that - winning the fucking lottery.  don't throw away that ticket without very careful consideration.  as to selling this idea to your g/f, you can tell her that this luxury studio apt at this tremendously below market rate price point is a very valuable commodity, and so you want to try to find the right person to sublet, or you have a friend that will need a new apt in a few months, so you want to hold it for them.  hell, that could even be the truth, depending on what the restrictions are for this place.  living with your g/f for 6 months or so should clarify how you feel about the relationship, and if things are going well, you can have a little internal commitment ceremony for yourself by finally getting rid of your old apt.    in my opinion, the place you describe is extremely valuable and any single person here would love to be in your situation.  hell, i have a rent stabilized place that we like, but if you told me i could have your manhattan studio, i'd fucking rent it right now and put my daughter in there or something.  an $860 luxury studio in manhattan?  i'd find that money, even if i had to sell candy bars on the subway for it. i wouldn't leave it until i could move into something better. i live in bk. i am in a stabilized apartment and i've applied for housing lotteries for years. its very tough so i wouldn't leave. i would rather be in a small place and save since its so crazy to try and buy. and co-ops have you jumping through fucking hoops. i had a friend that had a great down payment, letters, and what they thought was a great interview and still got denied. i think you are being reasonable and should say you want to prioritize saving so you can be in a better financial position to buy since your rent is so great. plus if she moves in with you her rent would be $430! that would really help. you need to die in that apartment, i'm completely serious. that's basically a car payment and a half. your concerns are completely justified. i wouldn't leave an apartment like that for a higher priced rental unless i knew that i was going to enjoy an excellent salary for the rest of my life. don’t leave. you’ll regret it! don't leave. your girlfriend can rent a tiny place to have her own space if she needs to and leave things in both locations and you will still be saving money. stay, pocket what you are not spending, leave only when you are buying a place. this is like one of those cursed gifts, like midas, you won the apt but you can never leave. seriously. don't leave. (also, not to be a downer but statistically your relationship has less of a guatentee than this apartment.) your girlfriend does not get to dictate your living situation. if she's not your defacto wife, then she's just some girl you're dating, and she could be gone tomorrow. if this apartment thing is going to be a deal breaker, then that's proof that the relationship was never going to work out anyway.  as a personal anecdote, after dating my gf for a year, she had to move **an hour and a half** away for family reasons. we made it work. it sounds like your gf might be living 20-30 mins away? there's no reason you need to upend your entire living situation just for a small amount of relationship convenience. it sounds like the proposed arrangement is beneficial to your gf only.  the only reason you should cave to these demands is if you truly view this woman as your life partner. if you're in the stage of life where you're ready to cohabitate, join bank accounts, and possibly raise children, then sure, get a new apartment with this woman. if not, live *your* life, and cohabitate when you're ready. i have a three bed in harlem for $1050 and when i got a new job on wall street my *wife* tried to think “oh good we can have a doorman building” and i made her take that *thought* back!   this studio should change your life calculus. well, it has, you are on a new curve, but you can fail to get air full advantage of it.  i’m looking forward to coming back to this unit in my 70s who knows how i’ll be and who i’ll be with. what i do know is i’m paying the rent every month. a lot of the comments are on cost savings. think about how to make a studio work for two and where you would need to spend to make it doable. there’s a difference of focusing on saving as much as possible and as making the space as comfortable as possible. have you spoken about that aspect with your girlfriend?  space maximizing: redesigning your closets, space saving furniture, a separate storage unit.  a do it yourself custom ikea closet is about 1k, kitchen units to the ceiling is about $500. beds with storage underneath etc. are you willing to redecorate with her?  are you planning on emptying half your possessions to make room? storage is about $100-$200 a month.  area: you didn’t specify your gender, but if applicable- dicey for men and dicey for women are two separate things. ubers, walking to/from the train station, other ideas. add $100-$200 a month.  work spaces: do either of you work from home, even occasionally? two people can’t really work from a studio. membership clubs/co working spaces etc to make it more doable could be 200-300 a month.   the best comparison isn’t current rent vs other apartment rent, but current apartment rent + adapting to two coats vs other apartment rent. you should not even consider this until girlfriend has graduated college and has started a career.   she is still in college and is fantasizing, you are in the real world and planning. she wants to go into film or photography, neither of which are generally high paying or even stable careers. wants to live alone in nyc after graduating, not realistic without a solid career. came to terms with how expensive it is and wants to dictate your finances. that’s not fair to you.   it sounds like you 2 are in far different places in life. you need to do what’s best for you. is this a humble brag? 900$ for a luxury apartment and you want to leave? i would understand if you want to start a family and looking to buy a house please don’t risk your affordable housing for a girlfriend lol if you need more space see if she can swing a studio or 1br in your building and keep both in your separate names. if you average the rents together and both contribute you probably still come out ahead as a couple. then you can use one space for mainly wfh or mancave or storage or whatever. unconventional but better than giving it up totally especially before legit marriage and home buying. yes, it would be stupid.   girlfriend =/= wife. and you won't get this deal again.  you don't know what the future holds, and like you said,  you'll be screwed if you end up getting an apartment that you can't afford on your own if it ends poorly.    look up some studio living ideas and see if you can arrange your furniture or custom make some furniture to make the space habitable for 2 people. don't leave until you have enough for a house/apartment, you have a kid who is old enough to climb out of the crib or you're leaving the city.   if you do, it's going to become a story about how you had a great apartment and have it up for a girlfriend that you're not even with anymore. curious. how did you find this unit? stay put. if you break up you stuck in a pricy new place. and she won’t be making much $ why is she so stuck up/demanding??? yes. my daughter’s boyfriend’s parents could only afford to rent in williamsburg when they got married at 19.  yes, it was were poor polish neighborhood back in the day. they found a rent stabilized one bedroom. they actually raised 4 kids in it and too - with the savings they were able buy a huge weekend farm near hudson. now 35 years later it is in the heart of a very changed williamsburg and he gets to use it by himself for months at a time.     his grandfather has a rent controlled apartment next to union square that he has lived in for 85 years. don’t look cheap rent in the mouth. it doesn’t matter how you play with the calculator here, i don’t think you’re going to find any upside to moving out. pls keep the apartment. this is the kind of concession that enables so much for you *both* lifestyle-wise and i’m a bit astonished that the gf doesn’t inherently pick up on this either. what happens if you stay in the apt and it doesn’t work out with your gf and she doesn’t want to leave? 😂 don't do it. and especially don't do it because a girlfriend wants to move in and wants you to leave that apartment behind. *huh* 😳 if i was dating someone i would want them to keep an apartment like that because that shows responsibility and living within/below your means. stay. save for a house. a house for you not you and a girlfriend. dump her keep the apartment. hi i'm a baby also only earning 45k please give it to me is this a humble brag, or you trying to start a bidding war. because in the right situation you probably could get several thousand. are you allowed to sublet this? you could stay on the lease and then not pay the difference in your new rent. i have a rent controlled 2bd 1bath in west la. i lived there for 10 years and now i sub lease it, i’ll never get rid of it do not leave!!! honestly i would keep it even if i was getting married. your gf seems to want to have you bear more of hers and your living costs together which is valid in a high cost of living city (splitting the usual costs of living) but you have such a deal that it’s not worth it for you. i think you should stay in that apartment and try to live together in it. if living together in that space doesn’t work out then you will still be able to look for something bigger but at least you will have tried that option don’t leave.  save for a home. you’ll be dumb as hell to leave that. you can save so much with double the salary. what if the relationship doesn’t work out? i wouldn’t leave the apt until i’m fully married and sure my relationship is for real. i wouldn't leave it. nothing's promised, especially in this economy. use this as an opportunity to save more and more. no not at all.   it would be stupid to not let it to me absolutely do not leave!!!! no no no no no no no women are replaceable. an $860 rent stabilized studio in manhattan is not.   hell, i wouldn’t even let her move in until engagement. the last thing you want is for this relationship to fail and then you’re stuck with her there in that small space get rid of the girlfriend my first thought when i read the subject was do not leave.     my second thought after reading more is that if you are going to pay the bulk of the rent on a new place since she won't be able to afford to - then she should be thrilled at the opportunity to pay half of your super cheap rent, rather than you paying the majority of a more expensive place.       you didn't say what her response was to you wanting to save up to buy something in 5 years.  i assume she doesn't agree or else you would  have not made this post to begin with.  so if your long term goals are not aligned, i would honestly consider that maybe this relationship isn't the right one. this is almost quite literally a cheat code for everyday living here in nyc. unless you're absolutely miserable or you know you can't make it work for your life style, then stay. i pay a lil less than double what you pay and my financial life is so much better than most of my friends. many have said it already but i’ll happily reiterate. do not leave. your amenities are a blessing. in unit washer and dryer. you have excellent transportation around you. you’re in a rent stabilized apartment. your income is growing. you’re taking in more than you’re putting out. if she’s moving in i’d really find a way to make it work even if it’s a studio. it’s doable. not talking bad on your relationship but the future isn’t always guaranteed. stay down and save up till it’s time for a home [deleted] hey hey, so this won’t be the consensus opinion but i represent an alt perspective that may be valuable to you. i got an amazing deal on a very spacious studio in washington heights, rent controlled at 966 a month. the building isn’t luxury but it’s very well run, clean, safe, laundry in building, near food and junk, blah blah blah. however… my life is downtown/in brooklyn. as aware as i am that i’m astronomically lucky to pay so little in manhattan, i also know what i’m sacrificing. i’m 26 and trying to cut a career in the arts, and i’m sacrificing so many opportunities based on distance. i’m also not anticipating a future partner to want to upend their life and move to the very outskirts of manhattan where nothing happens. i’ve made peace with the idea that i’m not gonna be able to hold onto this if i want to get real milage out of my life, even though on paper it’s ridiculous to move. you have to look at life holistically and objectively. is it safe and smart to stay in an apartment that’s the deal of a lifetime? of course. but what kinda life do you want to have lived? a safe one? then stay put. i’m not being flippant — if stability and comfort are paramount to you, then *stay where you are*, sincerely. but if you want to roll the dice on things you deem more important than those two factor, you’re gonna have to make concessions that strangers might look at as ludicrous because they don’t know your lived experience.   sorry to get existential, this just hit close to home lol so this exact  situation happened to my brother. he got a housing lotto studio in a super lux building for peanuts. eventually his gf moved in and they wanted something bigger. they were able to upgrade to a 1br for an increase, but still well below market rate. my advice would be to begin talking to building management and inquire about a bigger apartment and what the requirements are.   if it’s possible to get a bigger one with a second tenant, convince your gf to move in and save money until you’re ready to buy. don’t go quadruple your rent (especially if you’re in a great building) for no reason. i didn’t even read the whole thing- don’t give it up! sometimes an apartment is more desirable than a maybe, down the road dream. keep the apartment. ditch the girlfriend! stay in the studio and save money.  it's better that you can bank your own money than giving it to someone else such as landlord.  your gf is temporarily unless you are getting married or something. she can be replaced. the rent sta ilized apartment is hard to come by and you will regret later on. do not get rid of your apartment.  she can move in and it’s a good test on the relationship and maybe she isn’t the one.  your financial goals need to also align not just emotional/physical connections.  you can barely even find rooms for that cheap anymore.  i can’t stress how idiotic it would be to lose your place for someone you are not even married to. this isn't my take, but they make good reasons why you shouldn't:  https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerknyc/s/ynvxp5qsx5 giving up this literal lottery win for a girlfriend? do what you want, there's a lesson here for future you regardless. yes this thread is lowkey amazing.  never leave op. if you don't keep that rent till you're 80+ and move into assisted living, all of nyc is angry with you 🤣🤣 follow up question: how many square feet is the studio? do. not. move. can you get on a waiting list to upgrade to a larger unit? i also won a lottery apartment nearly 10 years  ago. i was originally in a studio, bf moved in after a few years. wasn’t too bad living together in a studio til covid hit and we were stuck at home. we got on the waitlist and upgraded to a 2br. the rent obvi went up some but they used the same ami that i was when i moved in even though my salary has doubled. def worth asking about! stay. don't give up that apartment. it makes no sense. would you give up a winning lottery ticket? because that is what you would be leaving on the table.  anywhere else you find is going to be 3x worse and marginally bigger unless it’s a 2 bed+ and even still those are pricey. the rent is still absurd in this city and shows no sign of slowing down.  you can actually save for a down payment on a condo or coop over 5 years at that price, you won’t be able to do that anywhere else. keep it 10000000% op girls come and go but a rent stabilized apartment is forever until you can afford to buy, i'd do everything you can to make that space work for two people; murphy bed, bunk, whatever is necessary.  that rent is way too good to let go. native new yorker here. i’d stay until i died.  ##find out if you can sublet that bitch for like $2200 and enjoy your life.   nyc is prime real estate. if she can’t understand that…well, consider that. she doesn’t sound like she’s good with money. your rent won’t double or triple it will 6x do not leave. don’t move; you’ll never be able to get this price again. $400 per person will allow you to save so much and be able to support a strong future for the both of you. hahahahaha relationships are cool but in unit laundry! bruh srsly keep the apt. ditch the gf is she stupid? what i get from this is that your girlfriend is not inclined to minor sacrifices (like living in this apartment and saving the rent you'd pay elsewhere) for large payoffs. it doesn't have to be just all savings either - think of the meals and trips and clothing this apartment will allow both of you. that character value would likely mark someone as incompatible to me. i know there are couples who live together in studio apartments, but honestly i just don't get it. even if you don't work from home, you probably do some work from home.  it just feels really rough.  then again, maybe less than 500 feet could be like the garden of eden with the right person.  there was an article just the other day in the nytimes about a woman who has lived in a rent controlled apartment for over 30 years. i looked at the photo and i thought: she was young when she moved in. with hopes and dreams.  and now this is what she's known for.  it's a tough world. you've found someone you love. someone you can imagine a future with. don't let this come between you or even stress the relationship.  if you can figure out how you can both live happily in a studio -- figure it out.  if you can't move. maybe you'll get another lottery apartment or she will.  maybe you'll fall in love together with a totally other neighborhood. who knows? the bronx? astoria? troy?  connect with people and dreams. happiness is not measured in square feet or by  your zip code. get a new girlfriend never ever leave the apartment for the lady. ask me how i know what do you do for work?  80k is a great salary i always felt rent stabilized apartments were a double edged sword for nyc residents.  if you can save and buy real estate in nyc, that is really the best trajectory for accumulating wealth in nyc.  just look at property prices in nyc 20 years ago.  if you use rent stabilized apartments to subsidize a lifestyle never to own property in nyc, then that would be a missed opportunity. do not under any circumstances leave that apt until you are married. you wouldn't be *stupid* to leave; maybe *emotionally compromised thinking* would be better phrase.   unless i were moving out of nyc or buying long term property i would not get rid of that deal. even then subletting may be an option. don't do it. if she can't understand why then the relationship is already doomed. i had a deal like this in the 90s. i’ve never left. i been here 30 years and it was the best investment i ever made. affordable housing is hard to find. agree with the rest of the post, invest the excess money. and for the record, i had 3 boyfriends move into this place over those years. none of them worked. now, no one is allowed to move in.  edit: my neighborhood was also a bit dodgy when i moved in. now it’s prime real estate. manhattan? don’t!!!!!!!! at least keep the lease for one more year while she moves in to see if yall are even compatible living together before you give that gem up for a more expensive place.  dont make permanent decisions for temporary people. i paid $900 for a studio in west los angeles back in 2002, co-use laundry room with 2 washers and 2 dryers for the whole building. that is not a typo, i’m talking about 2002, or 22 years ago. do not leave your apartment. ever. do not move, save your money for a down payment. do not give that apartment up i have a rent stabilized one bed for just under twice that w/o the luxury nor any of the amenities in central la, in the hollywood media district and bordering west hollywood. killer spot, south of tourists, not murdery (moses’ high school mates aren’t that spry, neighbors are old testament aged jewish community).   my answer to you is this: to get me to leave this apartment with similar but not nearly as good shit going for it as yours? for this value and this location? dude, i don’t care if dove cameron was the gf, the only way i’m leaving this place is if it burns the fuck down around my person. stay put homie you'd be financially regarded. that's mathematically equivalent to an extra $2000 a month going in your pocket. you're one of the luckiest people in nyc to get a deal like that, it's almost as good as winning some real lotteries. it sounds like she's barely gonna pay for the bigger apartment. so she doesn't get a vote. i’ll take it off your hands. i could move to nyc and live near my doctor, if a sad story helps in your decision process, otherwise, stay in your apartment and make it work. don't ever give it up! staying in this apartment feels like the fastest way to save up to buy a house. that seems very worthwhile. why add all kinds of risks getting a bigger apartment? yeah the gf might want more space. all the more reason to save up now and buy a house sooner. getting the current apartment was literally a lottery win. unless the gf is so great that she is a better lottery win, stick with this stabilized rent setup. don't leave do not give up that apartment. you sound very practical. your long term partner should be on the same page with you about saving. this is an incredible opportunity to save for your future. don’t give it up. i will shit on your head from a distance so great the rent will destabilize if you even think about leaving that apartment don’t worry about the girlfriend unless you actually intend on marrying her. did you go forward with the lottery appointment? would your rent increase with what you’re making currently? otherwise, i’d stay where i’m at. girlfriend will be fine living in her place until yall get married. i am telling you right now to never give up that and i’m telling you this as someone who had a luxury apartment and lost it, i was paying $800 to live up the block from barclays center biggest regret of my life please do not lose the apartment if you have to then get a new girlfriend a studio is nowhere near enough space for two people. you’ll resent each other so quickly simply because you won’t have enough space to breathe.   save for a few years. let her save for a few years, then go rent out a 2 bedroom in a good area for less than $3500. put a day bed in the second bedroom and convert it into an office space. if one of you is pissed at the other or is sick, you can sleep on the day bed and stay out of each others’ way. 2 bathrooms or a his-and-hers bathroom also helps with this if you can find it.  you should want to stay in your relationship more than saving a bit of money, and having breathing room from your partner is extremely important in forming a healthy relationship. i don’t mean that in a pessimistic way. you really just don’t want to have cabin fever where you can’t escape and have a moment completely to yourself, and small problems (like dirty dishes or clothes on the floor) build up a lot quicker when you don’t have the room to shake them off. yes. lemme get it just save as much money as possible for now also here to volunteer as tribute convince her to move in! explore a murphy bed and multipurpose furniture. the price you’re paying in rent is well worth the sacrifice in space in my opinion. coming from someone in a small railroad with a partner and two dogs. yep spend a couple of thousand and make the apartment livable for 2 people. you would be paying $400 a month for rent, if you move you will be paying prob $2k a month. i’ll take it if you don’t want it as many have suggested, don’t leave your apartment. have her move in. rent a storage space if needed, and it’ll still be waaaaay cheaper than moving. i would never leave. no way. that’s.. damn i’m jealous i left my $1888 non luxury apartment in midtown east to move in with my boyfriend, now husband. the difference is we were **buying** a place, and we're each paying about as much as the rent was in mortgage (actually a bit less, i'm also including electricity and maintenance fees etc in the new price).   perhaps we could have moved in together anyway and still not paid more than that each. but for $860, i think we could have stayed there lol.  i wouldn't leave. gf can move in. no better way to learn if you really like each other than living in a studio together lol! dude i’m a good person, give me this apt please $860 rent is a crazy good deal anywhere in nyc… even if it’s in washington heights or manhattanville. at double that price you’d get an old run down studio in jackson heights queens.  i say keep it, it’s worth a lot more than you think it does. get a storage unit and have her move in. you can set yourself up for success by saving and investing all the money you will not pay in rent. you could also take a few vacations a year to relax. yes, for all the reasons you describe (financial and relationship wise). as someone whose relationship didn’t survive a move-in, i strongly urge you to think, think, and think again before giving up this apt for a gf. i’d stay there for another year or two and save up for a down payment on a home.  this is actually exactly what i did and how i was able to save enough to purchase my coop. even if you don’t want to buy in the immediate future, it’s nice having a huge safety net or money saved for a big purchase. i'd find a trustworthy friend or something that would take over for you i'll live with you, don't leave.   curious- where in nyc? yes sublet it to me i’ll keep your space don’t leave this amazing apartment for a girlfriend. at least make her a wife first before you give up this low rent. you should stay where you are you need to check if the lease allows this, many of these type of situations have a household income limit. keep the apt and get a second spot if you really need the space tell her what you told us. it will suck, but we are saving for a house. she’ll feel like you’re focused and committed, instead of lukewarm and cheap. and if she can’t hang in a tight place to accomplish a shared goal, do you really want to wife her?  keep the studio. worry about financial decisions with another person when you are married i’m sorry your gf needs to get real. you don’t let go of a stabilized apartment. you just don’t. *especially* if, like you said, you’ll probably be paying for the majority of the expenses.   either your gf is not from nyc and doesn’t understand how *insanely* lucky you have to be to get a stabilized apartment for that price, or you’re both being a bit stupid. sorry bro hit me up i'm an incoming columbia grad student!  for real though do what's best for you. is your quality of life worth the extra cost? if so and you can afford it, move somewhere else. staying and paying the inexpensive rent is great if it doesn't affect your quality of life too much i’ll take it :) yes honestly, if you see a future with the your gf (i’m talking marriage) explain to her that this would be a better financial decision for the two of your long term; yall can save up to buy something of your own never give this apartment up i’d stay there till i retire yes. based on the headline alone. yes if you have a rent stabilized lease that means your kids could have a rent stabilized lease - don’t let that go it if you can  you’re on the money friend trust your gut absolutely stay where you are. your current situation is a goldmine for renters. i envy you! honestly i would keep it and save as long as you  2 can tolerate it. also what if you break up in a couple of years? you won’t have this place to go back to. i'll take it. yes that is stupid don’t leave many have hinted at the right answer. you can legally sublet for two years. when the time comes, dont let the apt go until you have to. i’d only give it up if you end up getting married. would suck if you gave it up and then broke up. plus can save for your future upgraded home while living rent stabilized longer i know someone who lived with their spouse for a few years in a studio. it was a little tough, but they were able to make space for each other by using the building’s amenities, staying with friends/family, and creating boundaries through communication.   i would recommend staying to save up as much as possible. around $430 on rent each month would allow you to save crazy amounts.   plus, it will truly be a test of the relationship if you can live together in a studio, and you’ll know for sure if you can be together forever if you can survive 2+ years in a small space like that. only if you didnt transfer the lease to me first ill pay you 2500$ to give it to me you’re being completely reasonable except the part where you’re worrying about a hypothetical 2 years down the road. save money and make the decision if/when the time comes. i’ll take it i pay about the same amount ($850) for a room in boston. nothing luxurious about this either.   only a fool would give up that apartment in this current housing market. doi i mean even if she moves on why not save for a hamptons home and just rent that baby forever how do we win lottery to apartments??? i need this type of blessing and i would never fumble it. ok kind of fucked but could you sublease it for idk 2k and use that extra 1100 towards ur new rent thus allowing you still to save? wait how has no one suggested subleasing it for higher some questions.   1. what’s her living situation now, and how much does she pay?  2. how much will the split be in the next place?   i moved in with my then girlfriend (now wife) in a studio during the spring of 2020, and while it wasn’t ideal, that was only becuase the world shut down and every waking moment was in a studio without any opportunity to really do anything.   however, we still really enjoyed each other’s company and it was fine.   now if you were to say it would cost $900/month, we’d both sign right back up for that in a heart beat. you would be as stupid not giving it to me yes keep your place and save  if she doesn’t agree find a new gf easier to find a new gf than an apartment like you have would your studio apartment be able to accommodate two people?  if you don't have the space to have 1 more person to live with you, it may make sense to get a bigger place than it is to pay rent on two separate places.  on the other hand, if you're unsure if the relationship would work out in the future. is now truly the best time to move in together? personally, i wouldn't be able to give up the apartment that you have now, but i don't know how much space you have. (i recently had to give up a really cheap luxury 1-br condo because it was just too small for us, but otherwise would have stayed there until we could afford a big single family home. sometimes, we have to make incremental sacrifices to get ourselves to our big goals in the future). uh, yeah. 👍🏼 you don't need more space. just join a coop office.. send her there to edit. enjoy coming home and sleeping in the same room. talk about where you could use the extra 2-3k a month.. like, eating out, co-op office.. new camera, macbook, travel, etc.. or.. one more room in your apartment. as others have mentioned, stay and save/invest as much as you can. at $860 (with in unit washer/ dryer! c'mon!), that's financial security!  if space is a big issue, i would suggest reworking your studio apt with furniture that is smartly designed to maximize space. (ie: murphy bed that can be converted into an office desk/book case) it might be costly upfront but it'll pay off with the amount of rent you'll be saving in the long run. why don’t you offer to subsidize a little bit of her rent (cheap, shared w a roommate) so you both are able to save and reach that goal quicker! yes, it would be stupid to leave. wow! never ever move!! manhattan apartments cost 3/4 times that much. maybe have it as a wfh space? do not leave!!! i live in a very cheap 2-br that i would have to be dragged out of and if i ever meet someone serious, we will be either be living apart together or ensuring that the apartment goes back to me if we were to ever split up because i’m not giving up my place and you shouldn’t either—it’s near impossible to find even a room under $900 without more than 3 roommates these days. if i had that rent and location, i would have sterilized myself. keep your in unit washer and dryer!!!! the answer is in your question. you’re not planning to move in together for years. keep the damn thing. this woman will drain you. keep the apartment forever and buy a weekend home. yes. yes yes. tell her to get lost and keep the apt dont do it!  unless you gonna marry this chick.  keep your place.  it could easily turn to shit and your fucked.  let her just come over and live in her own place. you got a great deal, but are you going to live in a studio with your girlfriend for the rest of your life?  what if you get married and have a child?  stay there until it is no longer practical for you to do so. yes, find another gf who understands the value of money. if it makes you feel any better my husband and i split a very small studio once for a few months and actually loved it because it helped us downsize everything and become minimalists. i miss not having so much shit, so much space to clean etc., it was really not so bad! do not ever give this apartment up -- unless you are able to trade up for a bigger unit in the same system.    i would do one of two things:  move in with the gf elsewhere, and either illegally sublet this one or keep it as a spare room and office.  (people illegally sublet them all the time and you can likely get away with it, but the worst case scenario is you lose it.). or, buy/rent a vacation place somewhere else, like maybe the catskills or the jersey shore, and convince your gf that the combination of that and the studio pied-a-terre is better.    in either case, there's a high likelihood you'll still have the apartment as a fallback should this wonderful relationship somehow not turn into a marriage. do not relinquish rent controlled apartment ! i recommend that you stay as long as possible. you will be crying splitting a 4000$ rent bill with your girl for a year just for her to abandon you and have you stuck with the bill. you have an opportunity of a life time. do not move until you find a bigger rent controlled apt. i wanna say def stay and lay out the situation financially - maybe once she gets on her feet in the industry here (assuming from your post) you can reassess, but this will financially put less stress.  as a woman, one thing to consider is that maybe she feels insecure moving into your space vs creating a new space together. you could compromise by letting her maybe redecorate a bunch, get new furniture together, make it a thing to turn jt from your studio to both your studio. especially with the savings lol.  but i 100% agree with the redditors here. don’t move. i had a roommate who moved out of our rent stabilized place to move in with his gf. they’d known each other since hs (but only dated long after college), gone on vacation with each others’ families, families liked each other, dating for 5 years. tbh really solid couple, seemed like they’d get married soon. 3 months into moving in together she cheated and decided to end the relationship. so yeah. do not give it up. i completely get it. my gf just got chosen for a lottery luxury building in lic. nice apartment, however, the train is a 12 minute walk away, the area is fairly desolate, and the i’ve heard some sketch things about tenant activity.   i am against taking this apartment due to these issues. i have come to realize that the lottery does not leave you with options as to what you truly value in an apartment and/or location. i rather spend more and have what i want, rather than take what’s given to me because it’s cheap. if all my wants were met and it was gained through the lottery i would be fine. however, that’s not the case for me and i’m sure some others. first - she is a girlfriend not a wife. second this is a huge red flag - especially because you are young. you sound financially literate and she sounds like a spendthrift. this is something that is absolutely important to align on for a lifetime relationship.   stick with the studio and save your money. it sounds amazing. buy a storage unit. if you plan on staying in the city no way you should give up that apartment. if you guys dont have cars tell her you’d rather get a car, parking spot, and storage unit. maybe even rent out a small area close by with basement space for cheap? i wouldn’t lose the apartment honestly you’d have to pry that apartment from my cold, dead, hands. especially if your gf is not going to be covering a substantial amount of the rent on the new place, you’re far better off living there and saving to buy. even if it’s small. you don’t even know if you’re compatible living with your gf yet, the security you have there is way too much to give up. yes you would > would i be stupid (to leave that unreal rent)  yes. yes #yes! never leave!  only leave if you’re actually leaving the city completely stay. you wouldn't be stupid, you would beyond that. a *complete fool* my good sir reevaluate in year or 2, when you’re actually ready to move in together. hopefully you can save a bunch in that time…  i’d say then plan to live together there for a year and test it out, which will likely make or break your relationship, but 2 people in a studio is going to be very hard. maybe also see if you can sublet for a year and try living together elsewhere, then see… man until you’re married and sure she’s worth it, don’t leave. or find a way to hold on to it if you can get away with subleasing it or something. i regret giving up my 2500/mo rent stabilized 2br several years ago. what's a housing lottery? is the unit free and clear? what do you have to oat for, if anything and how much? i'd keep both places if that's the case. don’t leave unless you’re getting married. you’d be crazy to yo. i got a teeny studio in times square for $500.  i will freaking never let that go. it’s not stupid at all just give it to me and enjoy your new place! i promise i’ll take good care of it, pretty please you better stay there yes don’t leave, if space for belongings is an issue get storage nearby and stay minimalist in the apartment. also i’m sure you’re aware but a lot of the time your rent will increase each year. so you’re only really locking in rent for a year nowadays as the market is so competitive (if you don’t sign a multi year lease) sublet to your friends yes you would be don't move until you get an equally amazing deal on a long term home. i pay $3600. not worth it imo. i can afford it very comfortably.. but it's not worth it. let me give you some context: my prewar (not luxury at all!!) rent stabilized 3 bedroom in upper manhattan (west 120s) is $4200 a month. you have to understand just how good of a deal this is. i would hold on to it for as long as i can. you would be crazy to leave !!! yes i’ll trade you an 1100 one in portland for yours bruh. dont let your gf fuck this opp up. dont leave stay in your apartment. let your girlfriend buy a coop or whatever. do not leave. stay on the lease. plz sell to me stay and stack your cash gl... do not leave. if you plan on leaving the nyc area that’s one thing, but you will never find that deal in the city again. you hold on to that apartment until it has to be pried from your cold dead hands. that’s how it’s done in nyc. hell no!!! please leave and let me have the apartment. i will pay you $400 to let me rent it in your place. $860 is unheard of anywhere in the country rn. let along nyc. don’t give it up. especially if you want to stay there long term. why do you need to move in to something bigger with a girlfriend? that's for a wife frame pie special dazzling bells gaping squalid plucky cake cover   *this post was mass deleted and anonymized with [redact](https://redact.dev)* i'll take it if you don't want it start paying yourself the difference in rent between what you are paying and what market rent you could afford don't move until you can buy! will you call me if you become single xoxo keep it forever! yes yes what lottery website was through this? do you plan on leaving nyc? if you are not making 200 a year i would look for places outside of nyc.  if you are making 100 a year then you are in a losing race and would only save to leave the state.  look at the value houses have gone up in the past 20 years. using that math increase the price in 10 years to see what you can actually afford by saving. yes sell it to her with the vacations you guys will take regularly from the savings. like winning the lottery often is for people, this is a curse. every decision in your life is now based off living in a rent-stabilized studio apartment. i pray it all works out for you. you probably won’t want to live in a studio apt forever. there are other rs apartments. maybe don’t give it up yet but if yall are together long term and want more space, would be worth looking for another rs apt uh.. need someone to take over your lease? partners come and go, cheap housing does not. you should leave it so you can learn a lesson the hard way. unless you absolutely need to move out, i think it would be unwise to leave that apartment. i recently saw a video about a room in nyc, just a tiny room with a bathroom down the hallway, going for $2200. you even have in unit laundry. i used to live in the burbs of li, and i paid way more for a studio and was lucky to even have shared onsite laundry. i’ll take this off your hands if you want to 🥹 never leave.  tell her the cheap rent means you can save together for a house, so suck it up for a few years, and buy something.  at nyc prices, this is a 2.5k market apartment, so save, say, at least $1k per month and put it in the bank every month.....in a few years you'll have the down payment. you’re paying nothing in the grand scheme of things. some of the cheapest co-ops in manhattan have monthlies 2x what your rent is, not to mention mortgage and insurance. i’d white knuckle that thing to the grave. dude i wanted me and my girlfriend to stay in. 1750 rent stabilized apartment, don’t leave! make it work do not ever leave 😂 that is the apartment jackpot. unheard of in nyc, those are 1995 prices! yes yes im i stupid for being stupid your apartment is winning the lottery.  it would really test your relationship to move in that tiny of a space together, but it would be very much worthwhile to save up for a place of your own.  also, if the relationship doesn’t last, you would still have the rent stabilized apartment in a great location.  that isn’t something you should easily give up. don’t move & don’t allow anyone to move in and complicate things you would be a fool to give up this apartment. she should move into the studio and start saving for a home or buy an apt or co-op. just figure out how to live in a small space harmoniously. bro i would get a bunk bed before i leave looking to make your two way union a three way union instead? i can volunteer. yes you would be..  save that money.. i envy you how long have you guys been together? if you guys have only been together for 2 years or less i wouldn’t be so quick to get rid of your studio. you should discuss your future financial goals together for buying a home, how much you and/or her would have to save to achieve this down payment.   if you’re concerned if there is a worst case scenario where you guys break up and get stuck in an apt you can’t afford, then you guys need to find apts where the budget works for both of you while still achieving some savings goal. otherwise don’t move in together yet until you guys can align on some your common life goals if eventually buying a condo is important to you. omg, do not get rid of this. live there and save save save with her. make it work!   buy the dream house/apartment once you know if you want to get married, have kids, if you want to still do city or suburbs.   sacrifice a little space now to be able to bank money and buy later on. wild that rent stabilization can result in something so far below market i wouldn’t give it up… but if you do…… please consider me as your first choice to give to 😂 when do you leave ???   so i can i can start moving in 📦🏃‍♂️ very i will happily take this off your hands. r/nyccirclejerk yes worry physical birds quicksand vast instinctive rustic snatch hard-to-find far-flung   *this post was mass deleted and anonymized with [redact](https://redact.dev)* give her a timeline, say we’ll save this much money if we stay here for a year, and then if after that year is over you both want to move do it otherwise keep living the dream this belongs on nyc circle jerk i swear bank your money and save to buy a place. or travel alot. you would be literally legally labeled as a retard absolutely. do not leave!! you should definitely move and pass it along to me 🤗 definitely don’t leave. there are enough comments with good reasons already. save your money. at that price, i would consider renting a 1 bedroom with the girlfriend and keeping the studio.   you never know if a relationship will work out, but rent control is forever. yes you sony find anything decent for less than $3,500 in manhattan i'd stay there for forever lol! i'd keep it forever at least. even if i'd get a place with my partner down the line, if i could afford both i'd keep it in case of a breakup or something. bro give it to me you try to make the studio work for the both of you first and save. if it is absolutely impossible living in the studio with her, then looking for something you can afford comfortably together. you’d be crazy to leave before marriage, higher income, and enough for a down payment unless you’re leaving nyc. i would recommend to not give it up. make arrangements with someone that you trust and have them move in instead. i have someone that can do that and can actually pay you more $ for it. 😁 lol please let me have it $860????? my dude, stay. stay  do not give it up, if she  does not see the value of doing that, do not let her move in.  the ? is this  why is she waiting 1 to 2 yrs  ? she not in town  , going to school ,  had her own place,  living with mommy  and what would her income be in two years to justify throwing away  more on rent ?  <<<  my girlfriend eventually wants to move in with me in a year or two   >>  ad if she really wants a bigger place, sure  no problemo baby  you get your own place,,, foot the bill,,, and learn finaces. oh to be in this position. i should have signed up for some lotteries years ago.  argh i wouldn’t let your current girlfriend affect your judgement or path on major life decisions like that. in any healthy relationship i feel you need to take care of yourself and have the ability to be independent regardless of your love for each other. you don’t want to end up in a codependent scenario.   like you said if it doesn’t work out your whole world would be turned upside down if you then had to move out right after a major breakup. you may end up with this girl, or you may not, but just enjoy the journey and process regardless and dont give up that golden ticket apartment of yours. yes it would be stupid. stead fast my friend, don’t let her influence your very level headed and well thought out plan considering the cards you have been dealt, stick where you and save! and if your girl doesn’t appreciate that fond one who will. let me get this straight:  your gf wants you to leave an amazingly priced apartment so you can pay double or triple rent because she wants more space?  you pay, you get to say.  your gf has some nerve wanting to explore a career in film on your dime and the audacity to demand you pay for more space?  keep the apartment, maybe lose the gf. how about this? don’t move in. keep separate spaces! yes but where is it? i have to move out by may keep it, your girl will be fine if u don’t have no one where else to go yeaa if you’re looking to sublet the apartment, let me know. i would be interested. keep it until you have kids. at that price keep it for your kids. i’d love itttt if so if it was in a nice area of manhattan i would understand to keep it, but in a dicey area of the city like harlem all the way to inwood, whats the point, other than saving 1000$/month.  why not figure out how to make an extra $1000 month.  half the people reading this are making 12k more than they did 2 years ago.   try maybe upgrading to a 1bed since your gf moved in with ya, they should have an upgrade path for people in your building. same as comments below do not leave and email me if you do lol don't move. that's the only move to make, and i hope you've been aggressively saving ever since you've moved in there 😅 in unit laundry, luxury studio 😭😭😭 you already won an apt lottery. why leave a good situation to an unknown future?  housing is the biggest expense for all new yorkers. please save your 💰 and invest. you will think me later. good luck. check your lease you may be able to sublet and can hold it and make serious money each month. was in similar situation in bk in 2003 and never read my lease before leaving. yes it would be stupid is she fucking stupid it's possible they will pay you to leave.  you could get like 20 k or so. yes you are being reasonable and insanely smart and your girlfriend is a dumb abuser  if she can't understand that she's using you when she's broke and have no idea how finances work, well sir you deserve better. she really has the audacity to not see a great situation you got going on. dont leave.. no no no if you guys are still together in a year or two...still don't leave this blessing of an apartment! unless your life is in danger living in that area you would absolutely insane to leave $860 rent in manhattan!   jmo where did you apply for that apartment? the answer is always yes honestly i don't think you need to move. i know several married couples who were in studios for several years and especially in a nice building with amenities like a roof deck, you can spend a lot of time outside the unit too. you could get a convertible bed/murphy bed, get creative with the space to make it work. do not move out of the apartment to rent. but you have absolutely must and will move out eventually.  i’ve seen a couple of families who have held onto rent-stabilized departments, as awesome as it is, it’s ultimately proved to be limiting . yes!!! keep the apartment.   get a new gf you would be more than stupid. i would stay in the apartment until the day i die! bury me with the apartment! idk if you’re stupid to leave cuz it might be cramped with just you two, but damn! that apartment really would become my whole personality. get a new girlfriend how does one find these magical apartment lotteries? yes! 🤗 hope this helps! amazed that you’d even consider giving it up! never never never. it’s even your future kids’ biggest legacy. absafuckinlutely yeah man that would be craaaazy!! i just got a shoebox studio in astoria for 1,600 and i'm right by the lobby door. it's terrible, with old ass hardwood and no washer or dryer... plus you don't really know a person at all until you live with them so who knows if you'll even be abke to live with her after the very first month in this market? you best stay and bless ur lucky stars bro no disrespect but stop simpi g you a grown man with your own bachelor pad forget woman and build. yes i want it :) if you leave it you should just go on and file for disability because your brain is defunct. stay if possible. the money issue is significant. also, u can tell your gf that moving in together doesn’t necessarily make for a happier marriage: see eg https://liberalarts.du.edu/news-events/all-articles/new-du-study-highlights-risks-living-together-engagement  finally if you (you and her, not just her) really want to live together, there are people who make their living by maximizing the use of small spaces. research and hire one. it could make your studio comfortable for the two of you until you need to shop for bassinets :) hey uh, what’s your girlfriend’s number, cause i just wanna ya know, uh, let her know that her “photography” or “film” career is hysterical to you. don’t leave the apartment!!!! that’s gold!!! do not leave that apartment until you are ready to buy something. incredibly!   don’t leave dude… paint it, maybe new appliances make it great and stay as long as you can .. save the rest .. it’s an asset.. if the gf leaves you will have a lot of bucks for the next one i think you should make a case for staying to your boo. see if she can meet you where youre at. it makes sense to live small to save and live big. if yall are able to communicate clearly and compromise. if youre able to hear what her meeds and desires are if you were to stay. like making it as comfortable and spacious of a conversation is so key. i say try staying! leave the girlfriend. keep the apartment  (if she still insists on leaving the absolute lottery that you have rn) don’t leave. stay and save save save. even if you get married stay and keep saving until you need more space. by then you’ll have saved enough to make the move worth it. ![gif](giphy|jfnnzajlxuit7ptnyx)  would u be stupid enough to leave a $680 apartment to answer your question  yeeeaaaaaaah 🗣️  * l.a knight - yes do not leave the apartment 😭 or if you do please give it to me (for my stepson who is a freshman at nyu stern) yeah no you’re paying 3x your rent for sure in this city afterwards. if she’s worth it then yeah move out. leave so the rest of us who don’t make enough money to afford living in nyc can have a chance and you can find something that suits your current lifestyle don’t give up the apartment. you two aren’t married and she doesn’t have steady employment. having this apartment gives you the opportunity to save a lot faster you mentioned. no you would be retarded. and yes, she would leave and your fucked. happened to me where my ex wanted a better apt instead of the fully renovated 2 bedroom rent stabilized 1200 a month apt. now she is gone. think about yourself. invest the money. your job could fold. if she loves you, she will go with long term thinking. if she doesn’t, you’ll find out untill you get married don’t leave the apartment, gf will come and go, apt like this will not.  imagine when she leave you, you will be in a new apartment paying a lot of money which you can have saved towards your retirement. one day you’re going to have to make the hard choice of leaving behind your rent stabilized apartment in order to pursue your dream life, but today is not the day. you’ve even spelled out how moving out in the near future would land you farther from your long-term plans.  i’ve lived in a studio with my fiancé and then husband for about a year, and we loved it. it was fun and cozy for the short-term and what a great financial start to our life together!  i wouldn’t give up the studio yet. call me old-fashioned, but i especially wouldn’t give it up for a girlfriend/boyfriend. i’d commit to the person before i’d agree to that level of financial and logistical entanglement. dude if you move you will pay 1800-2000 for a basement in queens. 😪 you’d be really stupid yes i’d rent it from you for $950 a month. i’m no-coastal and home base is sf bit my daughter is in school in manhattan and so it would be amazing to have a place to stay without paying expensive hotel fees - i could visit her more often. i’m 49 years old single and reliable to pay you rent on time. @healwithmarianna on ig tell ur gf to kick rocks to be honest, don’t leave the apartment, it will be easier get a new gf than a new city apartment in that condition. please give it to someone who needs it like me, i make less than $45k a year 😭 yes rent that, i am interested yes you can't just leave it!! ever!!! please figure it out. i think you are not stupid to leave the cheap apartment because when your gf move in, where will she put all there stuffs? plus you said the area is sketchy.  i am not sure which area you are referring to.  dm me and i will take a look keep it, maybe sublet it to a friend but don't ""give it up"" i’m currently in a $1360 1 br and i really want to move because of some maintenance issues. the building isn’t great but i like my apt 🤷🏻‍♀️",697,544,neutral,0.4657739698886871,1241,"would be insane to leave that apartment. it's not that you'd be insane to leave. it's just that you'd be insane to leave for all the reasons people have put below. if you want to leave, ask her to move in, and split the rent. you will save for the future. also, you might not make it. ask her to move in, and split the rent. you will have way more options doing this. i would"
9,Trying to find an apartment in this city is humaliting and disrespectful ,"yeah, it fucking sucks and just keeps getting worse and i have no idea how to stop it. hang in there i hate that working class neighborhoods are still expensive af. but $2,100 for a studio in a shithole area is way too much. there are still stabilized 1br for $1,600 to $1,800 in decent parts. going through this rn too. its so depressing to work as hard as i do and be employed full time and barely make enough to even get approved anywhere. and to know the places ill get approved for are gonna be shitty. like i’m not picky at all, i don’t need anything fancy. but i’d like enough room for a bed. and somewhere that feels relatively safe. like why is that so much to ask don’t use zillow lol, use streeteasy the worst part is the collective legislative edging we were all put through during the pandemic - stupid shit like broker fees were almost done away with [removed] well said. i know this sounds naive but i don’t understand the huge jumps rent stabilized apartments have taken (are able to take).   also, from last fall to early this year, prices jumped a lot in areas like kensington and bensonhurst and bay ridge, places that used to be less ‘desirable’ *and* much less expensive. but, going back to 2019, for sure, big jumps.  there truly is no one elected fighting seriously for anyone going through this. there *are* tenant groups and i respect their work. and i do think it’s worth writing to the public advocate and ny city council. the idea that post-the height of the pandemic period - and everything everyone went through - that there is no concern about this is really sad. (i also think, generally, when nyc people don’t have to move, there’s some mental protection where they sometimes don’t want to hear about the challenges of people who are in the midst of it.)  also, people like bloomberg who wanted “the luxury city” - and got it - didn’t help, to say the least. yeah you ain’t looking in the right places if you’re seeing 2100 for a studio lol. if you want cheap look in  crown heights, lower bedstuy you can find decent deals there still. you can smell piss in the streets of even the west village, i wouldn’t focus on avoiding that, lol. the thing nobody ever addresses is the property tax. most buildings are hit with a 12% property tax. 3 units or less is 20% (how does that make sense). if the building is assessed to be worth 1m (most are probably more), that's 120k a year before a mortgage or anything else. for a smaller building its 200k.  as the property value increases so do the taxes and expenses which leads to higher rents. yes but only if you’re not rich / well off. nyc is ridiculous without doubt but i’m skeptical of $2100 for a mott haven studio. you’ve got nice parts of harlem, morningside, upper carnegie hill that are renting studios at $2000. plenty of $2000-2500 studios and 1bdrms in manhattan alone. the worst part is that people theoretically did care and passed laws that have made things much worse — like not allowing landlords to ask for extra security deposit (now they just decline you if you’re risky in any way, or require an expensive guarantor service where you pay a fee equivalent to a security deposit you don’t get back) or protective eviction laws (yay!) that seemingly are so protective they’ve made landlords hesitant to rent to anyone with non-perfect credentials or no guarantor. not sure what eric adams has to do with the rent? he didn’t create this problem, if anything the city council did do you folk think some of the demand side factors are pushed by the fact that nyc is overglamorized in the media etc? we don't want you in mott haven gtfo out here lol nyc belongs to the wealthy, let’s face it. eric adams is awful but not the real problem. jerome powell literally goons to posts like this you seriously think voting eric adams out is going to reduce property/ rent prices? the numbers have gone up everywhere. realtors aren’t going to come down in price no matter who that mayor is. 2100 in mott haven? foh! just move if it’s that bad! no job is worth otherwise stop bitching! nyc you live her for the opportunity otherwise move to clt but no one cares about your whining i'm in harlem in an ok area and there's a 1bd apartment sale for close to 400k and 1bd apartments for rent starting at 3k . the nearest train is at 125th and lex.   what i'm trying to say is that it's insane to live in the city as a new yorker. i’ve had a 2 br 1 bath for 19 in the bensonhurst area. wood floors granite countertops and it was earlier this year too. our politicians keep catering to landlords and we must put pressure on them to start caring about us. eventually the only people able to afford this city at all are going to be making 300k and up the things you described are all the hallmarks of a free market. go to anywhere else that has similar competition and you will see similar examples of what you described. welcome to the neighborhood. we have to combat predatory landlords for anything to change. the city won’t do it, so tenants need to learn how. start tenant associations in your buildings. learn how to report 311. don’t be afraid of landlords. learn about whoownswhat, justfix, housing laws, housing court, and orgs in this space. the second best day of your life is when you leave nyc.  the best day of your life is when you return. if you can afford a nicer building they usually have a leasing office. like in lic, just walk into a building and ask in there a leasing office. avoid brokers fees this way. also tho i’d suggest jersey city as an option. a couple stops out of the city and sometimes 25% cheaper. i fully agree with you.   it’s the insane demand in a city with a major housing and affordability issue. i blame a lot of idiots willing to bid up rentals (yes that is a thing now, sadly) and willingly fork over absurd rental prices propping this up. getting rid of adam’s and replacing him with any mayor won’t lower the rents. the only candidate that you will have a choice voting for will already be a puppet of the real estate lobbyists. there’s a reason even adam smith had a negative view of landlord exploitation. not the ghetto welcome to new york i work in the commercial real estate space for national investment firm and i can tell you really easily why new york rents are terribly high, even more so post covid: multifamily rental companies have started using ai software that basically amounts to price fixing, this is why post covid rents have gone through the roof, this is compounded with the fact that there’s never been enough housing in new york. they need to build more housing, but the cost of building is sky high in a pro union state, also property taxes are through the roof as well. all of these things compounded amount to stratospheric rents. correction. mott haven is the gentrified ghetto. but yes there is no housing. the non-gentrified ghetto is more like gun hill, maybe crotona park east, more hunts point or that area. but yeah you have no chance at getting an apartment there. somebody could die and their name would still be on the lease for one of those places. chiming in from the bay area in ca and it’s the exact same thing here. getting ghosted, needing 4x rent, needing 4 months of rent in your savings (and screenshots), like $8k at signing, interviews, open houses. it’s literally exhausting. there are tons of non-gentrified areas of brooklyn and queens that are affordable. they are not hip and your commute will suck but you will get housed. preach it jersey city is your answer.   hop on the path and check out the waterfront, downtown, and journal square areas. you're guaranteed to find more value for your buck.  it's likely wayy closer to wherever you work than mott haven. my old commute to my office on 42nd & 5th from journal square was shorter than my collegues from queens and brooklyn i just got a nice 1br in queens in a quiet neighborhood for 2100, and i wasn’t even lucky. there were a ton in this price range. you’re really overstating the problem saying a studio in a loud neighborhood is 2100. ok welcome to nyc 1) nyc is a dirty place. there are blocks a stones throw from billionaire's row that smell like piss and have vagrants.   2) the bx is a great place. please don't move there and turn it into lic or willy b. please also don't shit on it. my guess is you don't know the place.   3) lls don't set housing policy. lls don't tell the suburbs not to build housing or even allow housing to be built. if you're unhappy w the housing crisis in nyc, then tell your local politician to step up and force wealthy neighborhoods to build housing changing the rent laws was like putting a brick on bubbling pot.  there is little turnover and landlords are now warehousing apartments. the politicians created this mess. the more laws and regulations they create the worse it gets. zillow search, 1br, no roommates, under 2250-plenty of listings

10,"""A rent-stabilized 1 bedroom apartment for $1,100? In NYC? The broker's fee is $15K.""","great piece that indicates why we need actual legislation about this. even as a broker, i think most people saying ""i'd still do this"" is why we need to change.  i emailed rebny earlier this week about this. it's out of control and needs to stop, and they're probably the only ones who can do anything about it since they block any kind of anit-broker fee legislation. i think they would be best to work with the city council to institute a broker fee cap, on the books dude that’s in flushing queens. not even a prime location for nyc. fuck off with a $15k broker fee. “the tenant paying the broker fee is what it is,” he said. “if you eliminate the tenant-paid broker fee for apartments, rents are going to increase.”  either way, we have to pay. rent at least can be stabilized. broker's fees are arbitrary with no regulation. rent is also spread out over time. broker fee is a massive lump sum that you're required to pay upfront. and it doesn't really go to anything that benefits the renter. rent is like ""well i'm paying to live here."" a broker's fee is ""well i'm paying this person my landlord hired to show his listing."" it just doesn't feel good. i don't pay for my super to service my apartment because my landlord hires him. why do new yorkers/nyc have rental brokers at all? that's not a thing elsewhere. by that math the rent is less than the broker fee if you look at it from an annualized pov… 15k would be 1250/m plus 1100 rent so basically 2350/month rent… idk how this is still allowed as a broker, this is shameful. this broker should get absolutely fucked for this, and deserves to be. they hammered a broker for this a few years ago charging $20,000 on a similar unit in the upper west side.   i have turned down more money than my 15% fee on stabilized units where applicants are begging to pay me more for me to put in a good word, give their application higher status. it’s not legal to do this and it’s a disservice to the landlord if you are disqualifying applicants based on self interest ($$) that apartment will get snatched up in a millisecond, and it's exactly why i left nyc. i love the city so much, but it's a city for the rich, not the commoners. so disgusting. it's an embarrassment to the entire city. ahh finally! let this blow up in the media so housing preservation and rent stabilization and the governor have to do something about it i have a decent full time 9-5 and after reading this i'm now considering getting my real estate license just to work as a broker on nights & weekends.   google says new agents typically keep 50% and more seasoned ones often get a majority of the rake. yes, you are they need to rent control and rent stabilized out of the system. we need a law to fix this. why only certain renter benefit from lower rent. that's absolutely predatory!   rent-stabilized apartments are supposed to be affordable options, **not cash cows for brokers.**   the broker's fee should be regulated, especially in cases of rent-stabilized apartments.   legislation definitely needs to catch up. this is messed up from the get-go, but of course is because there is such a limited supply of housing in new york city in the face of the huge demand. they won't rezone the outer boroughs for greater density, and when you pass legislation like rent control and rent stabilization, it's inevitable that all parties will try to beat it. landlords want maximum possible effective rent, and wealthier tenants are willing to bid up the price by any means. broker fees beyond the reasonable value of the service they provide, which is questionable in these days of the internet, just amount to increasingly effective rent. i always wondered if they kick some of this money back to the landlords; otherwise, why bother with the brokers. if you have a 15% or more broker fee for a stabilized apartment, you're just raising their rent in the immediate future to market rate. people pay it, so hopefully they can stay there for many years and eventually benefit from the lower, stabilized rate. i would think a court decision could be forthcoming that would realize this and do something about these broker fees. what if the city auctioned off leases on nycha apartments, where the new tenant would pay 25% of their income as rent, but people might pay $100,000 or more as key money. that wouldn't go over very well, would it? two of the quotes from the real estate agents are literally arguments for why the landlords should be paying for this and not tenants:  “they [landlords] want to hire a professional, someone who does this full time and closes deals efficiently and professionally…”   “when the landlord is hiring the broker, they’re the ones benefiting from the headache the broker is taking off their shoulders,” mohamed said. “they definitely put in a ton of work in helping the landlord sift through applicants and prepare that space.”  if i didn’t hire you and i found this apartment on my own, fuck your door opening fee. hahahahahaha what the fuck hahahaha  just get rid of brokers anyway, growing up in florida they didn’t exist. they certainly don’t need to either! they need to just outlaw broker fees or limit them to $1000 for properties under $10k/month rent. just build more housing. brokers deserve to make a living, but c’mon. 75% of a months rent seems flat out generous for what they have to do. man, what happened. brokers used to be the exception not the rule pre-covid i’d pay it honestly. you’d come out ahead after 1 year. i don’t mind it. they could do $2000 per month and 6 months free so effective $1000 per month but then year two you pay $2000. if you plan to stay for a few years this is an awesome deal. why would anyone be against broker fees? if the landlord wants to work with a professional that’s willing to spend the extra marketing dollars to find better buyers/sellers, it should be up to them. just like the fees charged by the person paying for the marketing should be up to them.  if you can’t afford something, move on. there’s no need to make it illegal just because you can’t pay. new york is one of many cities in the us. you don’t have to live here. you can go live somewhere you can afford. vote with your dollars. that what capitalism is all about. go to small town and start offering the services you love having here and help that town become something special. some places are filled with roaches and bedbugs. just saying. yes and they make the rental market way too competitive for people because they check your credit score, income, past rental history, letter from employer. just to rent i mean that’s horrible but still a bang for your buck in the long run. brokers fee of more than 100% of the rent should be illegal. i imagine the fee is to make up for the fact that rent raises are limited by law.   it's the natural consequence of artificially depressing rents that cannot even rise to match inflation. and i mean actual inflation, not the bullshit number that the govt puts out.   renters in nyc have it pretty good imo, and i'm one of them. [deleted] i would take it of i have cash would do that in 2 seconds downvote all you want, i’d take it in a heartbeat! [deleted] 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 any way to publicize this even further? did they not just see that the last broker who tried this was fined an amount significantly higher than the fee they collected? fuckin greed i remember like not even ten years ago when $1100 was just ""rent""..... so, if the rent is 1,100 and rent-stabilized with broker fee and my current rent is 1,700 rent-stabilized, wouldn't it make sense to take the offer if you plan on staying long-term? if you stay three years, it's still only 1,500 on average lmaooo what o stop the fee is legal for the service. you can't legislate a black market. deregulate and apartment prices will fall. what do brokers even do at this point? if you are a landlord and want to rent your apartments, simply list them for rent, show them, and process any applications you get. if you have so much rental stock you can’t do it all yourself, then you should be making enough money to hire an assistant…really pathetic and lazy behavior tbh. in any sane system the paying party (tenants) would at least have control over who they hire and there would be competition for who brokers to provide the best service/lowest rates. instead we have a parasitic industry that charges orders of magnitude more for the exact same thing that happens in other cities. if my last broker is reading this, i'd love her to defend why she thought $2000 an hour was a reasonable rate for showing me one apartment that was a 10 min walk from her office, emailing me four times, and collecting my application. “we’re giving an undisclosed amount of the fee back so the governor won’t fine us for our bullshit” lol so ridiculous they should be fined out of business. so disgusting fucking insane and absolutely shameless. i wish city leadership would get their heads out of their goddamned asses and instead of spending $16m on some piece of shit post-modernist art exhibit of a midget taking a shit on 14th street they just pocketed the money themselves, told lobbyists to fuck off, and made this garbage illegal in between texting their wives good night and doing a line off a puerto rican strippers ass. at this point, i’d rather the tax bukkake me and my loved ones get on a biweekly basis get spent that way.   don’t even get me started on brokers.  source: work in pere brokers are fucking parasites.   and they need to be eradicated from this city like the parasites they are.   it's absolutely unacceptable that this exploitation has been allowed to persist for as long as it has. broker’s fees need to be federally banned. it’s a racket and these pos don’t have to do a god damn thing. anyone know exactly how rent control and stabilization got passed in the first place? was it a fluke? great depression crushed people and so many offed themselves or suffered permanently that it was politically expedient?   how bad does it have to get to re-up this fight for better fair housing standards?",627,168,negative,0.8217045068740845,795,"you're just raising the rent for the immediate future. people pay it, so hopefully they'll stay there for many years and eventually benefit from the lower, stabilized rate. i would think a court decision could be forthcoming that would realize this and do something about it. i'm a broker and i think this is why we need to change. i'm in queens and i'm not even a broker. i'"

12,DO NOT PAY FOR BROKERS,"$1488 is too good to be true.  also ""self view"" with a broker fee is insane mind you, this lady not even showing the apartment. it feels so scammy. id suspect it’s fake to begin with. if they actually had a stabilized place for $1488 they’d stay firm at 28%. if there aren’t 30 people waiting to see it, it’s fake or a inhabitable bros just showing how made up his job and fee is. he’s willing to move it down to whatever random number you suggest lol when i moved here, anything above 10% was absolutely fucking crazy.   i hate that times have changed to this. also why????? 😫 oh no what's the address i'll pay the 15% for that rent. one this is an obvious scam.  two pls know what you want to offer before starting to negotiate, it puts you on weaker ground, when you first said 15% and then said one month. if one month is really what you want to offer why even bring up the 15%! bruh that’s a scam - pay in installments??? scammmmmmm who is that btw blast him can someone fill me in as to why there even *are* brokers in ny? in california you just find the complex online, see the rent they're charging and do all the negotiation with the office of the complex. the concept of a broker for an *apartment* is completely foreign to me. report this person for asking 28% scammy mcscammer 28%  i'd resort to terrorism that is fucking outlandish that number is also fishy /fashy. 😬 i remember when brokers just got paid on referrals. 1488 as in the symbol of hate? this is more than a scam, this person is most likely trolling. “legally acceptable to me”? i’m vehemently against brokers fees. they are sooooo inappropriate why are you negotiating with yourself? if you didn’t want to pay 15% why did you say that’s an acceptable amount? it should really be the responsibility of the landlord brokers fees are total bs... they expect to take one months rent without doing shit. i totally refuse to pay them. we should push for law changes regarding these broker fees. there’s a bill to get rid of broker’s fees in nyc now by councilman chi osse. hopefully it passes yes it's crazy but so are you. you asked for 15% and got it, and now you are saying that's still too high. you look like you were just baiting and wasting this person's time to make a point. that's just being rude for no reason.  for the record i also think broker fees are very expensive and very annoying. this most useless people on this earth: nyc brokers this has so many red flags i wouldn't even entertain this. lmao this broker is the worst negotiator ever. i bet he ended up paying the renter 15% the problem here is not that a broker is trying to collect a fee, its that the person trying to collect a fee isnt a broker. this is a scam if he’s that willing to negotiate, it’s going to be a bad deal regardless of how much of a “deal” you get. i moved in august 2022 and the best, truly epic deals i found had broker fees ranging from 6-12k. mind you i’m talking about studios and one bedrooms in the $1500/month range. it’s very easy to report brokers, and i did so gleefully. i ended up paying a brokerage fee of one month and was pissed about it, but the guy advocated for me and i got a cute, comfy, rent controlled 1 bedroom with a private yard for my dog for 1900 in a decent location. so whatever i guess.   tldr: brokers’ fees should be illegal. report shady brokers. it’s a scam that’s way above average for a brokers fee and way too cheap rent just viewed an apartment from a broker charging 15%—10 minutes before we showed up, he texted to let ourselves into the apt. i asked how to get into the building and he told me to wait for someone to go in or out and ask to be let in. insane. the apt reeked of cat piss. 1488 he’s a nazi report him bro never pay for brokers!!! [deleted] i think i’ve only ever paid 3% of annual, 28% is crazy and so is 15% legal or not can we collectively boycott apartments with brokers fees? only rent from places with no broker fee. most buildings do not require brokers fee. i’m going to get slammed with downvotes, but the point of 15 percent is that you can have your own agent who is your fiduciary get 7.5 and then the listing agent gets 7.5. i get that 15 is a lot but there is room for you to have a representative.   if i am just taking a client direct to a landlord and it’s not my exclusive i charge one month.   for a regular 12 month lease anything over 15 is bonkers.   it’s not illegal though. there are times with short terms that even a half month is over 15. as a broker, 28% is so fucked up. so is 15% but still. that person should lose their license june 12th 9am city hall!!   chi osse is organizing an act to essentially get rid of these stupid broker fees.   the proposed act/law is that if you hire a broker, you pay the broker. if you see this spread the word! https://www.curbed.com/2024/06/chi-osse-broker-bill-interview.html i mean the rent is so low that it makes sense for them to take a higher cut.  the rent is literally less than $450 per month. it’s actually indescribable how good the deal is as long as the apartment is habitable. what if someone gave you something of value to sell and it was upto you to get your commission. you would not want the buyer going directly to the seller. it's not a scam. it's called business.",593,110,negative,0.9011960029602052,703,i think. i paid 15% and he let us in.i. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi. i’m a nazi
13,Council member to reintroduce brokers fees to be paid by landlords,"exactly everywhere else it’s paid by the owners only in nyc ( that i know of) it’s paid by the renters nice. brokers fees are fucking dumb. oh let me pay an entire months rent to someone because the landlord wouldn’t? fuck off i’m a broker. i support this. the landlord’s should pay the broker’s if they’re the ones who hire them. anyone who disagrees is either bad at their job, or doesn’t actually bring value to their clients. yea im so ready for this. it just blows my mind that you can charge up to 15% of the annual rent for an apartment. you’d think you were helping me find my forever home. it’s insane to think i’m paying for a broker helping a landlord. i think the bigger win for renters is the airbnb ban the state implemented, no short term rentals less than 30 days.  a ton of inventory has hit the market due to this and thus helped slow the insane rate rents were going up.    i know an owner that was clearing $9k/month for a 2bed walk up via airbnb and now is having trouble hitting $3,200/month on a 12 month lease. it's been standing there, unable to pass for years. if by some miracle it does pass, the mayor is going to veto it, and then will need 2/3rds of the city council, which is not happening either  so 🤷‍♂️ i work in real estate in nyc and i fully support this. i’ve never met a broker that did enough work to justify the fee. in fact since the pandemic most listings i was interested in just had a lock box to see it alone and somehow i still had to pay a fee. again!? yay! professional tenants and scumbag tenants are a reason brokers have a job. its cheaper to outsource the due diligence than risk any one of those two scenarios. i have to pay a weeks worth of rent on a one month supply and get this the broker didn’t even show up one of the porters are show us the unit that is definitely going to come back to tenants. this comes up every year or so as the broker fee issue does suck but the real issue is the vacancy rate   it’s a bandaid solution that only works if you as a tenant are only staying for the initial lease period. if you move every year or only are here for a year then this all makes sense.   the shift is when you stay longer. and most units rent for 2-3yrs. the problem is that the fee can get baked into the rent but when you renew the rent doesn’t adjust down bc there’s no fee to pay now.    say a unit is 2400 w a tenant paid fee but owner raises it to 2600 to pay for the broker fee & since you don’t want to pay a fee, you shift funds around & go with the 2600 unit  2600 owner paid fee, so net rent is 2400 for that owner for that first year.   but say you stay a second year, even w no increase in rent, you’ve now paid that 2400 broker fee again.   a 15% fee on a 2400 is 4320 paying an extra 2400 each year would be 4800  and if you stayed a third year w no rent increase then you’ve now paid an extra 7200  if that same 2400 unit is tenant paid (at a 1mo rate) so the net rent for you is now 2600 for the first year essentially the same as owner paying the fee on a 2600 apartment.   stay a second year (assuming no increase) & your net rent over the 24mos is now 2500. stay a third year & net rent to you is now 2467 over 36months. the one time fee erodes the longer you stay in the unit.   or say the market rate for the same unit is 2400 & increasing the rent to cover the broker fee won’t move it. so owner does 2400 for the first year. pays a broker fee so net rent to owner is 2200. if you renew, i could see an owner doing a $200 increase to cover that fee from the first year so now your rent goes to 2600. and the law says if you’ve been in the unit for less than 12mos, you only get 30 days notice. every owner will wait till the last second before sending that increase. so it’s either you decided to move within 30 days which is its own amount of work & cost & time. or you bite the bullet & pay the increase.   so now that fee you avoided paying in the first year gets recouped in the second year. and if you stay a third year & there’s no increase from 2600, you’ve paid the 2400 fee again which is more than a 15% one time fee.   and what i can 100% see happening is brokers will show these units & tell folk that there’s a rent if you pay the fee & a rent if the owner pays the fee and if there’s multiple apps on a unit then someone might even offer to pay the broker fee & pay the owner paid rent rate to beat out the others.   i know in others places the owner pays the fee always but the vacancy rate there is much higher so tenants have more to chose from. but our vacancy rate is like 2.4%  the only thing that will fix broker fee issues is the build more housing. and build more actual mid tier affordable housing, not constant giant luxury projects.   without more units the vacancy rate will stay low & the problem will get worse.   broker fees suck. brokers are mostly horrible. but when there is a major demand & limited supply, these one time fees make more financial sense for a tenant over time. yeah, this won't come back to bite us on the ass like the cap on renovations and vacancy increases on ret stabilized apartments.  it won't make a difference for market rate apartments, ll are charging the maximum rent they can get away with, and they'll have leverage with brokers to get better rates. renters will still get screwed somehow, paying fees before they can even look at an apartment, exclusive contracts, etc...    rent stabilized apartments will be worse. you are now telling a ll that not only can he only rent the apartment for 40% below market, needs to take a loss on any improvements made,  but now he'll need to pay a fee to get somebody to live in it? this is going to open up a world of abuse that makes the $15,000 broker fee the good old days. the broker fee will just be added to the rent and the tenants pay higher rent.   this is worse if you understand math…  just making a valid point don’t kill the messenger!!   example with broker fee -   rent is $1000/m for easy math.   $1000 x 12 = $12,000  broker fee 15% = $1800  yearly rent = $13,800   2nd year - rent went up $100 rent for the year - $13,200  because rent only goes up on the actual rent amount not the extra fee added.    example with broker fee added in rent - rent - $1000 x 12 + $1800(fee) = $13,800 broker fee - $1800 - added to monthly rent  monthly rent total - $1150   2nd year - rent went up $100 same  rent for 2nd year - $15,000.   when the fee is added you pay the second year at the higher. that makes a difference $1800 the second year and gets bigger each year making the one-time fee apartment way better long term.  add on: i’m literally showing just the math and getting attacked by a bunch of idiots that don’t understand how a free market works or it’s a choice to rent or use a broker.   downvote all you want but it’s cheaper to use a broker if you plan to stay more than 2 years. just some advice to help!  downvote because you can’t change or control the facts. i don’t care! im a broker. save the hate please. im just a regular guy trying to make a living and i’m not “rolling in dough” by any means.  i get the broker fee hate too. nyc is expensive! plus there are asshole brokers that simply don’t care.  assholes are everywhere! lol  as a tenant your interaction with a broker may be limited, but their work does not start and end with you.  it’s often weeks of work to rent an apartment.  there’s also the cost of listing on streeteasy which is $7 every day it’s listed, photographs, floor plans, etc.   and landlords 100% raise the rent when listing a no fee apartment.  they often have a number in mind based on previous rent and expenses and if they pay a fee as well they totally bake it into the rent. we can advise on market rent, but even we are often surprised when the market drives the price above where we thought it would go.   i do think that the landlord should be required to at least share the fee with the tenant as they both have a vested interest.  one looking for a qualified tenant and the other looking for quality apartment. if this does happen (even though it probably won’t, they’ve already tried this) it just means your rent is going to increase way more.    you’re not going to save any money by this, you might even end up paying more than you would have. it’s just less money up front but rent prices alone will increase more than they would otherwise.   this isn’t the solution that they think it is - they should focus on other problems (like apartments sitting there vacant - fine the owners) but i guess time will tell!   there are so many things that they could come up with to better new yorkers and make the process simpler… but they bring this up like every year just so it makes it seem like they’re doing something so they get reelected. it’s a topic they’re “continuing to fight for” even though it’ll never change.",586,191,negative,0.5787817239761353,777,"you only get you’re not allowed to move or you give the landlord 30 days notice. not allowed or you give the landlord 30 days notice. not allowed or you give the landlord 30 days notice. i’m a broker. i support this. the landlord’s should pay the broker’s. anyone who disagrees is either bad at their job, or doesn’t actually bring value to their clients. i support this.."

they are one of the biggest families too. they also have a brokerage scam running to collect broker fees even though they have a leasing office my last place was with bronstein managment and they def weren’t as bad as all the places here, but i wouldn’t recommend them. the super was mostly awol and never responded to maintenance requests (my shower took 15 min to get warm) and the management office is a mess—they tried to charge me rent the month after i moved out bc they never realized my lease ended and that i sent them a vacancy notice, it’s taken them 2 months to give me my security deposit back. the lobby was also dirty and packages kept getting stolen. the apartment itself was perfectly nice and was recently renovated, but it felt like they had no interest in maintaining the building arthur pinkus - has a property in harlem.   when i complained about big roaches in my apartment, he gaslighted me into saying it’s normal living in nyc. he hired the cheapest exterminator possible to shut me up and “treat” the building, which sort of helped but not really. come to find out, the roaches are coming from my filthy neighbors upstairs that have been living there forever. he also threatened to evict me because of the “constant complaining”.  you cannot exercise your rights as a tenant to him without getting upset and gaslighting you. not worth the headache. feel like this should be made into a post or google sheet with all these and pinned in this thread so people can run down the list before renting abeco management took a month to get my security deposit back. they pretty much ghosted me until i threatened with court 567 w 173 st!

i rented from them in bed stuy for a little over two years and only recently escaped from that apartment, which had no windows or ventilation in any common space. roommates didn’t disclose a history of black mold in the bathroom ceiling and vents, because the landlord had just painted over it for the third time…it ended up coming back within 6 months, and it took me a solid five months of bullying highview before they came by to actually replace the ceiling.   their office staff is maliciously incompetent, and i caught them in so many friggin lies over the last year that i lived there. ended up leaving due to life events shortly renewing the lease for a second time and was told to “just get a sublet.” when i told them i wanted to go through a proper lease changeover as outlined in the lease so i could have a clean break from the apartment, they waited until the last possible moment to go through their paperwork, and then emailed me what was basically a handmade sublet agreement because they “didn’t feel like doing the paperwork.”  that moldy apartment was a major reason i had incredibly poor health for the last year and a half, and most likely contributed to my pet’s death. i wish them ill. “sol” at “soloman management” (though he is probably had shuffled around the name) is an absolute scumbag. classic fake luxury property with a flooded basement full of mold he painted over (flooded 4 times while i lived there) - when we moved in the fridge was full of rotten black liquified food.   many other issues - then he tried to duck me on my whole deposit. i was attempting to sue him but he wouldn’t even provide a last name , which i never got. found his office and had to show up there to shake him down and he folded like a dog with his tail between his legs after i chewed him out in front of all his colleagues and cut me a check.   he mostly rents in bushwick and ridgewood https://www.openigloo.com/ great thread!

(no income, also why i was moving out.) i asked why she waited an entire month before calling about this issue and that nathan indeed agreed to use my security deposit for july. she yelled “well then take it up with him!” and abruptly hung up on me. i never got a call from nathan so i’m assuming he realized he’s not losing any money since he used my security deposit and a new tenant moved in two days after i moved out. hager management is greedy, shady, will not give a crap about the condition of their apartment buildings. do not move into their buildings and if you do, make sure you report everything to 311. when i started doing that i’d get threatening calls from nathan stating “we don’t do that here. we deal with it internally”. no you don’t. you just don’t want to get fined for having people live in inhabitable places. seth miller/aegis realty. crown heights & the bronx. i pray for his death avoid any buildings from nieuw amsterdam property management or the orbach group (specifically on the uws).   my roommate and i had to get the city involved in order to get our lease broken. the apartment building we were renting in should be condemned. ultimately we were able to get a vacate order issued which forced management to let us out of our lease.   there is an absolutely devastating [nyt article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/20/nyregion/nyc-affordable-housing.html) about slum lords in nyc which heavily featured not only my landlord but my apartment unit.  the tldr is that our apartment was infested with roaches, spiders, and rodents. we could not keep any food in the apartment because of the roaches. they were even inside the fridge. management refused to help us. in our attempts to get help we started to suspect our apartment was illegal (which ended up being true).  2 weeks after the city ordered a vacate notice on our unit and we moved out, they had already rented out our apartment to a new unsuspecting couple. wmw realty is the absolute worse arnold rosenshein (park slope) is shady af w deposits/front door safety issues but actually keeps apts clean and things are fixed. luke warm no.   also he splits his time btwn the hamptons ues and palm beach l m a o prasad management llc — landlord is impossible to get in contact with and the super in my building is the laziest man i have ever known. national grid had to turn off our stove’s gas line because our oven’s pilot light wasn’t lighting and was just leaking gas out into the apartment. it took over a month for them to bring someone to replace the pilot light, which took all of five minutes. my fiancé called the management office to complain about the super not coming and the response he got was “well, what do you want him to do about it?” maybe his job?  eta — our apartment was renovated before we moved in but it was done on the cheap. the tiles in our kitchen are so cheap and flimsy that i dropped a bottle of olive oil while making dinner one night, fully expecting the bottle to break, only to realize that the tile had cracked, not the bottle. hello i worked at housing court and i can say the majority of our cases were from a few landlords/companies. specifically i remember a lot of cases with renaissance equity holding and with any landlord or llc with a mailing address at 199 lee ave, i think several landlords have mailing addresses rheee menashe battat in hell’s kitchen. he owns a few apts in the atelier, i believe brooklyn too. very inappropriate behavior, but the only one that really affected me is when he paid my deposit back in installments 😑",539,178,negative,0.9461537003517152,717,"never got my security deposit back. i took him to court, won, and he’s never paid my security deposit back. nieuw amsterdam property management and any associated properties are slumlords.

15,I need to rant about new NYC apartments,"this has been happening for years but its reach is even wider today. nyc for the less wealthy are offered “glorified dorms.” the use the cheapest material, most confusing layouts and tiniest of rooms, but oh! there’s a pet spa on the roof 🙄 you must be new here. and you left out one important thing...closets!!! people need closets. anything that doesn't fit in your closets has to be in your living space. i've seen some new apartments in brooklyn, overpriced but doable for me, but tiny closets. so frustrating 😤 looking now. good income/credit but a dismal experience. i went to an open house in the ev today, and 50 people showed up. a 150 sf apt; the studio room was so small the frig was squeezed between the (full/double) bed and the wall. 2200. wtf. i applied for a place slightly bigger, les, not great at all; it's been a week since they haven't answered my app. they asked for more financial information, which i gave them. they are obviously going from the richest applicant on down. i'm in a nice airbnb, a beautiful place, and same price as a regular apt but deep bk....ugh damn bro. you didn’t have to call out my living situation like that lmao i looked at an apartment once. it was gorgeous and was being subletted by the owner (which was a turn off to me anyway because i didn’t want to deal with that). and there was no refrigerator. actually there were two “mini fridges” the type i had in my dorm in college. how does one function without a fridge? for 3,000 a month?! insane you are correct on all of the above. i am moving into a much older apartment next month. you forgot about the lack of kitchens in these new buildings. i have yet to see a new apartment with a proper kitchen. it's always just kitchen stuff along one wall in the living room. what's next? a toilet in the corner of the bedroom? yes. >*it's like the developers tried to squeeze in just one too many units per floor which ended up making the square footage of all the units on the floor borderline unlivable.*  correct. i think one of the issues is that a large part of the market for these apartments are young people with roommates and who don't really care too much about long-term quality-of-life, or life inside their home when nyc is out there waiting for them, or having a reasonable budget that will allow them to live long-term (whether they're kind of yoloing on their own salary or have family assistance to pay the rent).  >*legitimately, how the fuck does anyone making less than 100k per year survive in this city?*  they probably do not live in new builds. lots of people will live in multiple-income households one way or another. and they hunt for deals and pounce on them immediately. and of course, dual or more incomes help a lot compared to a single income.  my first and longest-occupied apartment in nyc was a large one-bedroom in a rent-stabilized 1920's pre-war elevator tenement building in brooklyn. it usually didn't have cockroaches or mice, and it was pretty large, good light, on the top floor, and in reasonable condition, so i loved it. however, it was pretty crappy by anywhere-else standards. plus they're hard to get into. i got very lucky.  my wife and i live in a less-than-20-year-old condo-style building now, and it's nice and affordable for our income today, but it was a very, very lucky find. the broker half-joked that she loved showing this apartment because it was actually adult-sized.  most of our friends are pretty reasonably paid professionals, lots of couples, and my wife and i are the closest to living in a ""luxury"" new build of anyone at this point. friends live in older tenement-style buildings or partial brownstones.  the older the stock gets, the more it tends to be adult-livable and was better constructed. a lot of this is survivorship bias as much as anything... anything built to very low standards a hundred years ago was probably knocked down fifty years ago.  >*hopefully this city gets it together and eventually starts building way more apartments (with actually livable floor plans).*  yeah, i hope so. in the meantime dig around in queens and brooklyn for something older. make a list of your must-haves and dealbreakers and focus on things other people hate that you don't mind.  when my wife and i started dating she had a nice deal on a one-bedroom by herself because it was on the sixth floor of a non-elevator building. i had a goth friend who lived in manhattan long ago and really liked living in a dark cave, so she got a good deal on a low-floor courtyard apartment. given the timeframe, they were both making around today's equivalent of $80k taking inflation into account.  was still tough for both of them given the pay at the time, but they made it work living alone.  when i first moved here, the broker showed me a similar dark-cave ground-floor interior apartment for like 2/3 the price of the one i eventually lived in. but that was a dealbreaker for me.  if you make significantly less than $80k in today's dollars, and are just moving to nyc, i think many people are looking at roommates/housemates, family (living with them or getting help from), or incredible luck.  my first building was full of retirees and working people who could afford their rent-stabilized places partially because they'd been there a long, long time. i think my next-door neighbor had lived there for 45 years and raised her kids there. she was a retired emergency-room nurse.  rent stabilization/control is a good thing imo, for long-term life, but yeah, we also need significant up-market construction of good quality housing to take the pressure off for people who want to move here now. this is why you always want to find an apt in a pre war building. solid walls and larger rooms. saw a $1 million condo in queens a few years ago that was new construction and same thing. not even a deeded parking spot for that price and no parking near the building i’ve been living in new builds / luxury apts for 5 years and i’m so so excited to move to a pre war. there so much bs to deal with in a big luxury building including an incompetent management plus everything you mentioned.   the only luxury buildings that seem worth in are in bk or manhattan and even then there’s only certain buildings that are really good— and studios in those buildings are at least 3.8k so here we are. honestly, i prefer prewar buildings. high ceilings and large bedrooms all the way. on top of it, they all lie about their square footage on the listings lmao welcome to late stage capitalism first time? roommate if you don’t make atleast 150k.  manhattan is a terrible place to live unless you’re making bank. go live outside of manhattan.  three types of ppl that lives in manhattan: 1) high earners 2) out of state folks that watches sex and the city  3) government housing folks. look for older buildings, over 100 yrs, in queens, bronx or brooklyn for large size rooms and apartments. the only way to afford it nowadays is to split rent with a partner (or roommate) and live 1-2 hours' commuting distance to manhattan.  my partner and i had a decent place in nj for a year, but the commute through port authority took years off my life, so we ultimately ended up in rockaway park, which is nice because it's at the beach, but it's like 1.5 hour from anywhere.  we rent the second floor of a single-family home from our landlord who lives below us.  we only got a good deal for this reason--we went through craiglist instead of an agency.  no fees or bullshit, and he never raises the rent.  unless you can get lucky with a private landlord, it's hell. this isn't just nyc. it's all new developer led construction in the country. look at places queens /brooklyn. not cheap but you get more space for your money. everyone wants to live in manhattan and there’s only so much space. as a liver in one of those weird apartments (housing connect so worth) if you can add door shelves and organization stuff from wayfair etc to the closet, it can become the dresser for you. makes no difference functionally (might be easier to find things too) and not having to place a big dresser helps the rest of the apartment layout fall in place. landed yesterday? 150sf?  for the whole place? that's 12'x 12' . my kid has a 600sf  in sutton place at that price point always has been 🌎🧑‍🚀 🔫👨🏽‍🚀 my 2008 build apt in atlanta is way nicer than the 2022 built one i had in ny metro. the build quality in new builds here still feels weird but the amenities make up for it. tons of amenity space, hard to find that in nyc without paying obscene amounts. i wish carpet was back in style (yes, i know it's dirty, but that soft feel is amazing, nyc unfortunately never had a carpet phase) and i wish floor to ceiling windows or otherwise giant windows went out of style (i like privacy more than light). totally agreed. people making less than 100k have roommates. the natives stay with parents for a long time. or people live in huge older apartments rented a long time ago from mom and pop landlords but they deal with a bad commute (20 mins bus ride to a train). i’ve done all these things, and i’ve also had the luxury studio to myself (in a neighborhood that most transplants wouldn’t tolerate). i’m over it and i’ve decided that it’s not worth it to be here. yes the new builds are terrible and probably violating building code behind the drywall. also watch out for crazy electric bills in new or refurbished units, with no real reason why. what you’ve noticed is what gets lost with the “build more housing” crowd. we are getting shitty builds that get evermore expensive. you just said what everyone who is either from here or has been living here for over 15 years has been thinking and feeling. it's bs. i'm in the midst of moving so i'm viewing apartment after apartment and quite frankly, it's disrespectful. my roommate and i finally found a real nice place off the j/m at myrtle-broadway, it wasn't renovated but it still was nice and had all the space we needed/ wanted... they were asking $5800 !!!!!!!! for a 2 bedroom duplex. with no curb appeal. nyc has gotten out of control. i'm over it. this is my last place. kitchen islands so big that there's no usable space in the living room to put a couch and tv newer construction typically follows a pretty limited set of layouts - very few closets, pullman style kitchen, and ~120 sqft bedrooms. they'll typically spend more effort on hyping up amenities or the appliances or whatever, which cost nothing compared to the real estate and construction. it's a little depressing. i live in comparatively new construction but i managed to avoid most of that. the last part of your comment is the most important. more housing needs to be built in ""high opportunity areas."" tell your elected officials. :( ![gif](giphy|ocmgluo7d5jj6) new construction units get smaller n smaller!  if that’s your preference then deal with the high price n small square footage!  otherwise look for prewar buildings. the cost of construction (and land) in nyc is so high that any new building is going to have rent that’s commensurate with the building’s cost. as someone who has lived in manhattan most of my life, and just left a job in real estate after 10 years, no one moves to new york city for the space. the best you should hope for is to have an apartment with nice light. lol my apartment is literally a plus sign as the floor plan and i can only fit my queen bed in my wife and i’s room. barely a dining table and a couch which we haven’t purchased a couch yet because i have no idea what size loveseat would fit in our living room/ dining room. rent here is 3,500+ for a two bedroom. i live in the south bronx honestly if you are in a place in your life where you can rent a condo, do it. it’s not always a great fit with roommates or guarantors or people who struggle with paperwork or need to move right away.   the floor plans are so much better.   also i realize not everyone wants or needs a tenant agent, and this time of year it can be hard to get one, but we can steer you towards places with good layouts.   also being flexible with location helps immensely.  best of luck,  suzanne older buildings are vastly superior to new construction!!!! much more livable and the window units are really not even a con. easy to control how hot/cold you want each room highly recommend looking deep into brooklyn, you’d be surprised how commutable it is into midtown and below. heavy on the half glass shower it’s so stupid and the thin walls. that’s my apartment to a tee. exactly why i stay in my rundown dilapidated building. this is what happens when you effectively ban new construction. all the “new housing” is just put into terrible floorplates. kitchens and living rooms are not included in this playset 😬 a lot of new apartments are also really poorly built even when they're expensive/luxury buildings etc the new units are so so so small don't forget, the ceilings are very short. and the heating is electric, so your electric bill is an extra 300 per month. welcome to new york. it’s been waiting for you. but what gets me is 800,000 people have reportedly left since 2020. how is the vacancy rate 1.4%??? like and before anyone answers migrants apparently the recent wave was around 200,000 but many have been moved to other cities and i’m not trying to be a bitch, but i have my doubts about migrants being responsible for the housing squeeze considering how harsh nyc landlords are about paperwork and income. as a native nyer, i'm moving to jersey because this shit is rigged. roommates and living further out in crappier neighborhoods. we need a r/nycapartmenetsrant sub i mean, there's a reason why pre-war buildings historically valuate much more highly than stereotypical new construction.  i live in a brownstone and a car ran into it. the car fared much worse. i loved my seven years in manhattan.  on a weekend out in the hamptons during year three, i made my exit plan.  i realized that the quality of life was horrible for the price and, unless i was very, very rich and had a second home someplace else, i would have only sloppy seconds.  the best decision of my life was that exit plan, but moving there was my second-best decision.  pay up and live in the center of it for awhile.   then decide it you want to scramble for sloppy seconds for the rest of your life. it’s just you. no one has ever noticed or mentioned it before, thanks for speaking up! move to jersey city no, not really my experience. maybe you are going too low dollar? yeah, it’s evil isn’t it? welcome to my apartment 😂 the only reason we can afford it is because it’s rent stabilized (thanks housing lottery!). my two bedroom retails for like $3200/month. yep. been there. had a storage unit tried all of them! manhattan mini, local locker, cube smart. cube smart made my clothes smell like cat piss. you are absolutely correct! the developers who are building these new apartments are building what i would say are the smallest spaces i have ever seen. for example, there is a development company that are constructing apartments with bedrooms so small, only a twin size beds could fit in them. moreover, the bathrooms only have showers (no tubs) that are so narrow, one could barely turn around in them. the door also hits the sink in the bathroom. all for the fantastic price of $3000+’per month! it’s ridiculous! i think ny is moving away from trying to accommodate families! people making less than 100k get roommates often 3 or more. and as long as people keep reassuring landlords their apartments are amazing and going into droves for their shitty apartments its gonna keep getting smaller and pricier.  meanwhile there's mice, roaches, and black mold going rampant behind the scenes. the funny thing about the word luxury is...if you have to say it in the name, it's not luxury. it's a label for common man, not the wealthy.  things that are luxurious just...are, there is no need to label them, everyone knows it is luxury. when you slap luxury on the label of something, the only thing you can be certain of, is that it is not actually luxurious. if more people would actually believe what a shithole nyc has turned into after pandemic, fewer surprises like this would have happened. the city has lost its charm. predatory landlord and uninhabitable properties are a norm now. the apartment i live in isn’t tiny, doesn’t have a weird floor plan, poor build quality, egregious pricing and it’s not labeled as a “luxury” apartment. so to answer your questions no you must be taking crazy pills or you’re ignoring the dozens of apartment listings that don’t fit that criteria. don't forget your bathroom will be as big as your bedroom because of mandatory wheelchair accessibility lmao the major brokerages in nyc are sothebys ( where i worked), douglas elliman, brown harris, corcoran, compass. i would call the front desk and ask if any of the agents are good at rentals and/or are new and looking for clients. i can send you names if you like. get rid of the zoning laws and processes in place to make building as difficult as possible.   this country has a weird obsession with “preserving the character” of a neighborhood, or whatever the fuck that means. most of the existing residential buildings in manhattan should have been torn down and rebuilt decades ago. [deleted] sounds like you’re looking at conversions. new york has a population density of 27,485  people per square mile. compare that with houston at 3,614 or phoenix at 3,105. what do you expect, gigantic apartments for a cheap price? they could build more skyscrapers but the construction costs increase geometrically with the height of the building.  since you new yorkers like to live in top of each other, you've got to pay the price. either live in an apartment the size of a broom closet or pay an exorbitant rent.",515,200,negative,0.5986307859420776,715,"the older the stock, the better. i think this is. anything built to very low standards was probably knocked down fifty years ago. anything built to very low standards was probably knocked down fifty years ago. anything built to very low standards was probably knocked down fifty years ago. i think this is just a case of survival bias. anything built to very low standards"
16,I beat the brokers,"on second thought, i think you're actually lying.  a $4000/month 1br in the west village that is legitimately huge apartment with (2!!!) walk in closets and a washer dryer for 4k/month? you would need a time machine for that.   a lot of this does not make sense. 300$ application fee? that’s nuts! nice job. fuck 15% broker fees and pretty sure that $300 application fee is illegal. glad you avoided the fees! most of the time, doing this isn't possible, but glad you got a break! i'm sure if it was in the west village, it was close to or more than a 10k broker fee, so no small amount of chump change by any means i wish more property managers in the city did their own leasing. can the broker sue the landlord/property owner?  is there some sort of exclusive?  good job. that 300 per person application fee is ridiculous. thought this was r/circlejerknyc the truth is that in many cases the owner/landlord probably despises brokers as much as we all despise brokers. the exception to that is when the owner is actually also the broker, or it’s their brother or kid or cousin and it’s all just a cash grab scam. but i think most owners despise the brokers in this city. love it!  fuck these scummy ass brokers. perfect example of how they are literally not needed. this internet mom/lawyer is very proud of you. great job! you are the best boyfriend — haha! congrats was it a condo or co-op? well played. hats off to you. enjoy your new home. that’s wild good job lol  there is a button to select no broker fees but i do know how competitive shit is",504,50,negative,0.5715766549110413,554,i’m sure it was a co-op. in the city. i’m sure there is a button to select no broker fees but.. i’m sure there is a button to select no broker fees but... arere i think you're lying... i think you're lying......
17,We should normalize posting the rent history of our apartments. Here’s mine.,"my apartment is on saint marks place in the east village. “3” bedroom. a 2 bedroom with storage space that management considers a “bedroom”.  since i redacted the name for his privacy, i just want to add.. same tenant from 1984 to 2008. that is until they forced him out by harassing him with endless frivolous lawsuits until he was financially crippled and then they offered him a buy out and he was forced to take it (i reached out to him a few years ago and we have become friends).  **edit:** for all who are interested: citi residents alliance is offering a [free virtual workshop](https://citiresidents.org/workshop) to nyc residents next wednesday at 12pm that will go over illegal deregulation, affordable housing & what you can do to challenge your apartments status. also, i just created r/renthistory if anyone wants to help make sharing our rent history a thing. i think it would be incredibly powerful! same thing happened to my mom. she was asking me if i had some mail delivered to her about an apartment at her building and when i took a look, i found she’d been paying 2 grand a month for a studio apartment that should have been listed for 1200 at the most. we negotiated a new apartment 1259 after that but from what i can tell, this is common. i’m not sure who was looking out for us but i thank them. is there a way to report an apartment that has inflated rent history on streeteasy? asking for a friend how do you find this? wondering about the same, just signed a lease to a rent stabilized apt, and i wonder where to find the rent history. we got our rental history and it says “owner occupied- exempt” every year since 2013. we’ve been here for several years. is my landlord committing fraud of some sort? should i be paying the last listed legal regulated rent? what do i do about this? who do i contact? at the end of the day..

 my rent now is $1,835.  i moved in 2020. i got my rental history and found out my apartment should 100% be rent stabilized and at a much lower rent. but i don’t know what to do with the information. if i take my landlord to court, then i have a landlord who hates me and that scares me. we have this issue, but honestly we felt hopeless and we are basically over paying. mainly because we have children and the idea of suing and possibly losing our apartment didn't seem ideal. so here we are overpaying. the owner refused to also acknowledge preferential rent, so yeah some landlords just do whatever they want. so you’re saying i can request the rent history and negotiate cheaper rent? my understanding is you can only challenge  starting at 6 years ago. my moms rent is $120. dollars and she’s been living there for 40 something years. it’s a 3bdrm and 2bathroom.   they harassed her for more than a couple of years after my dad passed away. so what us the current legal rent for the apartment represented by the form? get an attorney. i know people whose apts were not legally destabilized and they got a ton of money back and also the apt was out back to stabilized. why that large jump around 1999? the best way to destroy a city… keep in mind that there is a 10-year statute of limitation. this means that the dhcr cannot act on infractions that occurred more than ten years ago. however, suppose the increase in illegal rent continues in more recent years. in that case, you have the right to be reimbursed for the difference between the rent you paid and the legal rent you should have paid, as well as treble damages (a penalty equal to three times the excess rent you paid during the last ten years).  i filed a complaint about an illegal rent increase 14 years after moving in when i realized my rent was higher than it should have been. upon requesting a rent history, which the landlord had intentionally concealed, i discovered that the previous tenant had lived in the apartment for 30 years and paid only $158 per month.  when i moved in, the landlord had only painted the walls, given me a new stove and cabinets, and charged me the market rent of $950 per month (more than twenty years ago).  after 14 years, i could only collect the excess rent for the last ten years, which amounted to around $4500. however, with the treble damages, i received $14,000, and my rent was reduced back to its legal amount.  it took over two years.  the process is not easy, and i think the landlords count on the tenants’ ignorance or inability to navigate the system, but it’s doable. i'm unfamiliar with all this, why would they artificially inflate the rent by false reporting? i’m currently living in a free market rental unit that was at one point a rent stabilized one until it reached a threshold to destabilize due to what i believe to be false reporting that is now beyond statutes of limitations for investigation. any advice? im so glad you started this conversation because i just recently got mine too!   didn’t know my apartment was stabilized cause they haven’t registered it in years and im being overcharged by more than $1000. it boggles the mind that people are afraid to take their landlord to court lest the landlord gets mad at them. your landlord may be friendly, but they are likely not your friend. you have a business relationship that is purely transactional. where do you find rent stabilized apartment in lower manhattan? that is very low .. even for rent stabilized    i have had mine 30 years and 1500 for basic small apt have you actually settled for $386.51 with your landlord?  your rent history alone doesn’t justify this amount. it only indicates that your landlords haven’t reported the rent since 2010. your unit might have been deregulated, or the landlords might have been illegally avoiding reporting. based on the picture, i think it might have been deregulated due to high rent clauses.  either way, good luck! my report lists a rent that is $300 lower than what i pay (the unit is rent stabilized). any idea what can be done? falls after 2001. hmm....hello major terrorist attack. i got my rent history and found that the landlord doubled the rent when a new tenant moved in in 2009, but i'm not sure what that means for me (potential illegal deregulation). does anybody have any resources that could be helpful? i’m currently behind on rent please don’t 😩😞 mail the state it takes a while like 8 weeks no we should get the doj to prosecute corporate landlords for collusion. regardless if it’s legal, apartment rents this low are thievery. nothing more… upload to openigloo stabilized map and include with your building review! so important for this to be public information - so frustrating dhcr keeps all this secret and relies on renters to request and challenge. how the he'll is a landlord supposed to pay his bills and make improvements if the tenant pays 386.51 a month. if he has to replace a fridge it's $500 bucks, to paint a 1br apt is $1500. that's why the owners are selling to corporations that empty the buildings and build $3000 high rise apts. how do apartment owners get them de-stabilized? how do you get rent history for an apt that isn’t rent stabilized but you think they’re lying and it should be? where do you find rent stabilized apartments? what is one supposed to do with this information? i’m confused what the point is well now i don't feel too bad about the new 2.75% increase. if you're paying less than 1000 a month, idk how i can sympathize with renters more than landlords. a single plumbing issue can easily cost 1000 nothing wrong about checking your rent history. curious if you believe a millionaire paying less than $300/month for an apartment is fair to the system and the tenants that actually need it? real ""hi, i'm the problem, it's me"" energy here. rent stabilized camper leeches being subsidized by everyone else's exorbitant rents. yeah this only works for rent stabilized apartments. they don't post this history if your apartment becomes destabilized or was never stabilized.   it's sad this post is upvoted so much,  because it's not productive.   i also got mine and after 2010 once it was exempt.",498,149,neutral,0.5202944874763489,647,"i’m wondering if i’m overpaying. my rent is $1,835. i moved in 2020. i got my rental history and found out my apartment should be rent stabilized at a much lower rent. but i don’t know what to do with the history. i moved in 2020. i got my rental history and found out my apartment should be rent stabilized and at a much lower rent. but i"
18,"Do you want to move, but can't because the up front cost is so high?","exorbitant broker fees (on top of ridiculously elevated rents) are an enormous issue. broker fees should be paid by landlords. a plethora of unethical practices by brokers (asking for bids on rentals, for example) also seem to be a common issue that renters in nyc face these days. it would be great to see these topics addressed in your article. yes! my partner and i are currently living in student housing for their graduate program. conditions are not ideal (water damage, pests, etc) but we can’t afford to move elsewhere. i’m moving because i have to but my savings are drained. i haven’t moved in 18 years and it’s overwhelming. i can’t believe i spent almost 6k on someone who spent five minutes walking me around an apartment and was annoyed when i asked them to show it to my boyfriend later. i mean what is there to say. during the pandemic i was paying $1750 for a studio in a walkup. now i am seeing posts in fb apartment groups advertising a room in a shared apartment for $2200 and above. it's $2500 for a bottom tier apartment (the sort that doesn't have a functional kitchen). $3k for a decent place. who the hell makes that kind of money? who is supposed to be living here? i make an okay salary - a bit less than $100k after bonuses. but i cannot afford any apartment in the city anymore, and i'm just talking about the rent, not even including broker/moving fees. i just don't know what to do. broker fees are ridiculously high (and they don't even help you) and things like ""good faith deposits"" just make it even harder to crack the surface of moving in the city unless you're making waaaay above six figures absolutely. crazy the lack of choice/movement in the capital of capitalism. the landlords know they have you hostage once you move in and the brokers don't work for you at all so you are bound to end up in a place where you are unhappy. the fees are so ridiculous that even trying to move to a cheaper place feels impossible due to the upfront costs. also the completely unreasonable earning requirements to qualify for even the worst apartments makes moving feel “expensive” as well. i’m blessed with a rent stabilized one bedroom that i’ve lived in since 2016 in a good neighborhood in brooklyn. my rent is still under $2000 a month. i always saw upgrading to a 2br when my partner and i decided to move in together. which wasn’t fiscally possible at the time. so now me, my partner, 2 cats and 1 small dog cram into my 1 bedroom. is it manageable? sure. but it’s not great.  i keep an eye on the market but everything is just getting more expensive. i’m the higher earner in my relationship so making a move to a 2 bedroom is worrisome when i know i couldn’t manage that alone. also when i look everything is a new development or a few hundred more than i pay now for way less space.    i love my apartment. but there is absolutely mold in the bathroom walls, all my doorknobs keep breaking, i hardly get natural light. all the landlord special paint jobs need to be stripped and redone. the appliances are no longer as new as they could be. the bedroom radiator hardly works. it was a brand new replacement and it just clatters unbearably and sometimes spurts out water. i used to have a roach problem i paid out of pocket to get rid of.    i'm blessed to be here. but i'm mid 30s and feel like i'm never going to be able to move out due to continually raising rent prices.  and even if i did find somewhere i could afford comfortably id be too scared to move somewhere thats not stabilized. its too risky these days to not be sure that your rent wont  rocket up one year.   sometimes it makes me feel like theres no future because im working just  to barely maintain a below market cost apartment. just had this problem this week. my wife and i were looking to move into a larger apartment because we are pregnant and wanted a bit more room and storage space.   we saw an apartment that we fell in love with, but were appalled when we saw all of the upfront fees we would have to pay: brokers fee, security deposit, application fee, and the background check fee.   not only that, but competition was so high for that apartment that the broker was pushing us to sign for the middle of the month and pay a pro-rated rent for the last two weeks of the month while we were still living in our current apartment, just to secure the new one.   not to mention, the apartment wasn’t even ready to live in; the paint was stripped, construction materials everywhere, and the floors filthy.   the broker didn’t have a clear completion date and kept saying “soon,” pressuring us to put down a “good faith deposit” without even knowing a move-in date. absolutely ludicrous.   all together, for an apartment that was $3,300 in rent (already absurd), the upfront costs were almost $10,000.   we opted to stay in our smaller apartment and deal with it.   to add onto all of this: we’ve lived in nyc almost ten years now, and have moved 3 times. no lie, every single broker we’ve ever dealt with is like this. unprofessional, pushy, with little regards for the client and yet expecting thousands of dollars for seemingly doing the job of opening a door and sending a few (shoddy) emails. the system is broken. yes. i feel like i save up for 6 months just so i can move.  2500 first month’s rent, 2500 security deposit and 2500 broker’s fee had me forking over 7500 in july, plus a moving truck and everything else involved in moving expenses. please draw some attention to the way brokers are evading laws & protections for prospective tenants. nyc doesn't have the worst renter protections, but these landlords and brokers go out of their way to ensure we still get screwed over.   brokers are now insisting that you hire them because if you hire a broker they can charge you anything they like for an application fee (vs having to stick to the mandated $20). since you cant go around a broker, you either pay what they ask or lose the chance.   there are currently no legal caps on what a broker can charge for a fee. it's completely arbitrary. even on a rent-controlled apartment, which actually tends to have higher broker fees because of their desirability.   with more and more ""mom & pop"" landlords falling by the wayside, avoiding the broker fee has become harder and harder to do. there is a myth that you can negotiate the fee. maybe a few years ago but right now brokers know how desperate people are to find housing. covid deals are gone and air bnb nyc has severely depleted the stock.   brokers' response to this desperation? hike up the fees to 15% sometimes 20% of the annual rent. i just moved into a studio apartment in hells kitchen today february 1st.   $1923 security deposit $1923 first months rent $3461 15% brokers fee $20 application fee  for a grand total of $7327  and since my lease isn’t up till march. i had to pay my regular rent of $1050 for my room in harlem too for the month of february. something has to change. seriously! i would be interested in talking! my partner and i have been looking preemptively (by nyc standards) ~2 months before our lease is up, but we're discouraged by what we've seen with rents and brokers fees and are now leaning toward not moving yeah i don’t like throwing away money 2-3 months worth of rent money to a broker who only opened the door to show me the unit… especially since rents are so high. it’s frankly criminal when that money would be better used towards retirement rather than wasted. i don't know what more i can contribute besides what i write here, but i just moved to nyc from a different state and it was my first time having to deal with all the stuff you mentioned. signed a lease late-jan.  * because the unit felt like good value at the rental price, i felt pressured to have to make a decision fast before getting to sleep on it and think through my options.  * had to pay a good faith deposit of a month's rent  * which moved to the security deposit upon approval  * had to also pay the 12% of the annual rent for a broker's fee  * and the first month's rent upfront  all in all, it was about $10k in cash immediately. luckily i knew about this somewhat so i saved up a decent chunk of cash, but in the 5-6 different apartments i lived in la, sd, and sf, i never had to deal with this kind of upfront payment. and after looking through a lot of apartments, i feel like 12% of the annual for the broker's fee wasn't even that bad. i saw so many asking for 15%, and even saw two different brokers asking for 18% of the annual (which was really annoying because the units that were in their portfolio were really nice and good value if discounting their fee... such a tease). i got essentially forced out of my last apartment because the landlord raised the rent an astronomical amount. i don’t really like my new place that much (absentee landlord/super with frequent issues in the building, including leaking in my walls), but i just can’t imagine going through the process of moving again - it was like a part-time job finding a place this last time, and the costs were incredible. between brokers’ fees, overlap of rent, cost of movers, and other incidentals, i just can’t afford it.   incidentally, tenants shouldn’t be paying broker fees. period. i didn’t hire this person; the landlord did. if they want a middleman, they should be paying for them. [deleted] does anyone know of any other cities where broker fees are a thing? i kinda just want to have a life, and lately the up front cost is very high. how do we fix that? lol left nyc last week because of this. i needed to downsize to stabilize myself, but the cost of moving unless i had a “hook up” was too much. i opted to move out of state instead. well i am looking to hopefully luck out on a studio $2k or less on an 80k salary. i check street easy every day and various other sites. wish me luck! it’s only possible if you’re a bit delusion. lol yeah. i'd like to move out on my own in the neighborhood i grew up in but i can't thanks to rising rents and gentrification 🙃 hi! i would be interested in talking about how i had to take a 401k loan to move because the increase in rent in my old apartment was too much. it will take me 5 years to pay it off dm'd as we are a linkedin group of over 4k members now and there are absolutely 0 fees while still ensuring real people with real housing. you forgot about bidding wars for rentals on top of that! i had to pay more to move into a different room in my coop building. for an extra $100 they were going to take someone off the street vs me who already had board approval / lived in the building and got along with the neighbors.   others have gone up way more than just $100. i would love to speak to y’all. i’m in the middle of a move right now and it’s an absolute nightmare.  my lease ended today, and i’ve been looking since november because i knew absolutely no broker would take me seriously if i reached out about a 2/1 move. i was looking all of december & even now… and it’s been terrible. even housing connect (the affordable lottery) **i totally understand it’s a lottery. i’ve been applying to those lotteries since i was 18, i’m 29. never been chosen. it’s gotten so sad to see everyone get priced out of the city… even people who make a substantial amount of money are having hard times getting apartments. something has to change i have several anecdotes to share about the lawlessness of renting in nyc, at least one of which intersects directly with nyt reportage of the recent past. kindly inquire within my dms at your convenience [deleted] hey nyt housing reporter (?), thanks for asking here - the ""victims"" - but how often do you come report on the power-injustice happening in housing court daily?  when do you talk about these multi-billion-trusts who owns all the llc that owns our apt-buildings? the ones that lobby city hall/hpd/albany into cancelling rent stabilization?  is 2024 finally the moment for the nyt to expose the real causes of nyc housing situation? yes, i want to move out but it’s impossible due to insanely high rent prices most of the rent stabilized, affordable-ish apartments in my part of brooklyn, plg, have enormous broker fees, and the brokers don't even show up half the time.   it's a disgusting practice, but i don't see any tenant friendly reforms on the horizon with real estate's #1 fan kathy hochul in office. that and her failing to overturn suburban zoning are moral failures in this polycrises.   it's very difficult to move. can we please talk about these brokers fees! i’m sorry but when did 15% become the new normal? i’m a transplant of 9 years and this had never been the case in my experience. my most recent lease was signed in 2021 and it was 1 month rent. i am now having more trouble than ever to even view the apartment because the broker is charging a 15% fee of the annual rent. it is extremely devastating and difficult.   that’s not even to mention that these apartments on the market are not in good condition. i’m not expecting to live in the nicest place in wahi for a 1bed at $2,000/month but someplace that has at least even flooring!   i know this is quite the complaint but it is devastating seeing cost of living sky rocket while the quality of living is very low. happy to talk to any journalist!   made a post in this same sub! doing a cross country move from sf => nyc for boyfriends job. he’s already there, i move in a month. we’ve had no luck the last 3 weeks looking for a march or late feb lease in the areas we are considering. we’re high earners and are floored by how crazy competitive this market is. we have applied to 4 places with all the recommendations of our broker, all paperwork and applications sent the first day of showings and are still looking.   we were already expecting ridiculous pricing and to spend at least 30% more in nyc to get less, but we didn’t know how bad the competition is or how fees add up.   managed buildings we’ve seen have mandatory amenity fees that add $150-200 to the monthly rent. they have tiny apartments but will charge you an extra $100 for storage.   one application for an uws unit went into a bidding war. we didn’t even know those existed for rentals. listed rent was $4,800 which was toward the top of our budget. apt ended up going for $5,300 by highest “bid”. it wasn’t even no-fee, there was still the 15% broker fee attached to that price.   another application for a rent stabilized apartment was given to the “most qualified” applicants even though we applied first. most qualified according to the broker just means those applicants made more money than us. so even though we for sure me well over required 80x the monthly rent, they still gave the rent stabilized apt to the people with the most assets.   the other two applications also didn’t land us a place. we have no idea why.   we don’t think we’re being unreasonable. we want over 650sq feet 1 bed to comfortably fit our things and 2 people, laundry on premise, a dishwasher and an kitchen layout w 2 squares of counter space. we don’t need amenities. we were willing to pay over $4k to be in a cute neighborhood with our wishlist, but with this market have had to increase our butter to 5k/month!!  we’re looking in the upper west side and multiple neighborhoods in brooklyn since we want to have a neighborhood feel, have an 1 train commute for work, and not surrounded by glass, concrete and traffic.   we’re finding that what we’re looking for is hard to come by and incredibly competitive.   being ready to hand-over 8k to a broker for finding a decent one bedroom apt seems insane but that’s what we’re looking at. over the course of a year the net rent of a $4,500 apartment is $5,175, a full 44% higher than what we’re paying now in a city new yorkers used to call expensive.   that’s not to mention that up front costs with everything will end up being close to 10 grand. we can afford it, but it’s a huge dent in our pockets we weren’t expecting to take on.   comparison point: we pay $3,600 a month including parking in sf for a 2x2 that’s just under 1000 sq feet. we found our apt w/o trouble a little over a ye sfo and were the first to put down a deposit as soon as our application cleared. 1mo deposit and $0 broker fees. in nyc we would for sure be spending at least $6,500 a month for what we get here. wild times. my landlord paid the broker fee but it’s a condo, so the application process took  4 hours with the broker and then another 2 weeks of back and forth. i also had to pay a lot more for application fees and they ask for move in fee and additional condo fees so my up front cost was all those fees that were close to $2k and then first month and deposit. i think i had to put down $10k and i’m in murray hill, not even downtown yes! i actually love (well, like) my apartment but i have now seen two (2) people die outside my bedroom window and witnessed a couple of teenagers shooting each other. however the upfront costs of moving are absurd and so are the rent requirements. if i made 40x my rent i sure as shit would not be living where i’m living lol i moved into my 2bd during the pandemic for $3250, fast forward 4 years and the price is now $4500 (split with a roommate!). when i sought to move after the initial increase, to stay in my neighborhood, i'd be paying around $7k-10k to move. i found a studio for $2700/m and it came to about 10k total in fees to move. market has been shit so it made more sense for me to stay in my apartment than leave. long story short, i'll be moving in with my partner who has been in his apartment for close to 8 years. he pays under 3k for 3 bedrooms but the place is genuinely falling apart, no light, not a great part of the neighborhood and desperately needs to be renovated. for what it costs to move and at the risk of getting stuck with a terrible landlord or management company (such as mine), were choosing stability over gambling with our money. yes can chat about it broker fees, plus the 40x requirement makes it feel impossible for someone making 45k to ever qualify for an apartment, even with excellent credit and more than adequate savings. wait nyt has a reddit account? woah one more trick that landlords play is, assume your budget is $2000, and you see an apartment that is $2200 but there is one month free on the lease, so your rent overall becomes $2000 per month.  however, next year on lease renewal you don't get a free month. on top of that the landlord will increase the rent by 5-10 percent on the base value of $2200. now suddenly you are paying a lot more than you initially planned. and now the cost of moving itself is very high, because you have to pay broker fee, deposits etc. and you are stuck. can i throw in these sort of newly mushroomed virtual rental dormitory style services like aya, roomrs, etc.?    small rooms, expensive, overrated, new but cheap appliances.   for an average of three people per apartment - while the application process is super quick, they charge ridiculous fees that are only seen as you’re about to sign the lease (member fee $125/month; domestic services charge (only 1x 30 minute cleaning of bathroom/kitchen) $100/month per roommate;  maximum $250/month flex fee unless you stay longer than 10 months); deposit of a month’s rent, once-off upfront fee of $250. $100/month/roommate flat rate for gas, heat, hot water, wi-fi   upfront cost is not as high per say, but if you stay less than 10 months the membership fee works out as a broker’s fee.   the kicker is: you are not allowed to see the apartment / room in-person, the photos make the rooms look bigger than what they are, can’t meet roommates unless lease signed; paper thin walls and doors!! no locks on the bedroom doors, and you’re expected to get household insurance for your personal belongings. no superintendent on-sight, or any immediate support of shit goes wrong.  i had to use one of these services because i ran out of time securing an apartment because of a few reasons - i did not  get a lot or any of responses to my application to shared rental postings on listings project, craigslist, etc. or i was competing against at least 10 other people at an apartment viewing on the border of brownsville and jamaica. please try to cover a bit about this:   around 2019 it became illegal to charge first and last months rent.  around 2020 a law was repealed that now enabled landlords to pass the cost of an agent onto the renter.   essentially, we (renters) are now forced to pay the same amount to move, except the last month is no longer prepaid and we are responsible for paying the agent fee, whom we did not hire (the landlord hired them).   it feels oppresive and gross that our govt allowed this protective clause to be repealed and it's now making our renters situation worse off. just a tip, try to sign for a 2 year lease, landlords are more likely to agree to this if not prime season (summer) i advise all renters to save as much as possible, these prices are not sustainable, get ready for the crash and buy. i did this in 2008, recession rolls around every 20 years or so.. 100%. i've been trying to move into the city from the chicago area for some time now. to even be considered for a tiny, d-rated apartment is completely ridiculous. [deleted] me!! would love to talk about this my bf and i are actually about to be broke but need to move into a larger space. $3800 apartment? ok let’s make you pay almost 8k in broker fees alone. for what? because this man just opened a door for me? that’s actually criminal. looking at a $15k initial move in cost. which is absolutely ridiculous and so discouraging and imagine your landlord not renewing the lease and asking you to vacate because they want more rent? 30 days notice or head to court for a holdover where you plead your case unsuccessfully.   more homeless on the streets and more to come. i’m moving to nyc soon and have been apartment hunting, and the guarantor qualifications are insane. i have co-signers at my current place because i’m young, with low income and new credit history. but in nyc most apartments don’t accept co-signers, only guarantors that must make 60 or 80x the total rent. so even if i would be paying 1/4 of the rent with roommates, they must qualify for 80x the total. it’s very difficult and i don’t understand why it’s so different compared to other cities. [removed] broker here: ""high broker fees?"" i've been in the business for seventeen years and broker fees are not any higher than they were when i started.      if anything, the pro-tenant laws limiting security deposits to just one month should be helping tenants, since they should be able to move with less liquid funds than they could ten years ago, when ""last month's rent"" + ""one month security"" was the more standard practice.     n.b. i am not arguing the ""the rent is too damn high"" point. i live here too. i messaged about the insane amount of fees i paid last time i moved 😅 i would love to move but i don’t really *need to… still contemplating on that since my lease ends in august i’m a single income earner and it damn near was $10,000 to move into my 1 bedroom in williamsburg with 1st ($2300), security ($2300), brokers @ 15% (~$4000). + moving expenses and furnishing (i moved up from roommates to none, had to buy a lot). brokers were able to charge 15% because of how great of an apartment at the price/location it was (and like yeah, it is, i expected to pay up and saved for 3 years). with brokers fee advertised in the listing there was still 250+ inquiries on the listing within the same day :/  edit: my search was 3 months long. idk how transplants are gonna do this from like ohio.   edit 2: math added i am a 22 year old recent college grad who moved to nyc from dc. definitely had a lot of struggle with the upfront costs hello. i’ve been looking for the better part of a year, and i have two cats.  i’m trying to escape a situation but i’ve been stuck, because even the shelters have space issues.   i would love to talk. yes! it’s cheaper to stay where you’re at. moving into a new place usually costs $7-$10k up front. that’s first last and security i started apartment hunting in manhattan and brooklyn in june 2023 and here’s a sample of my experience. i started earning six figures and was looking at apartments at $3k and under. all over brooklyn and most neighborhoods of manhattan. for the life of me, i could not escape either a broker fee or the most strict application requirements. anywhere in cobble hill, carrol gardens, or williamsburg had a broker fee. usually, it was 10-15% of the annual rent. i once had a broker tell me the most incredible thing: the 1bd apartment i wanted in east williamsburg was available to apply. after exchanging some messages, they finally disclose the apartment would have a 15% broker fee attached to the listing. this was to dissuade any ‘unserious’ applications as the broker knew the apartment would be extremely popular. it really pissed me off knowing brokers will shift their fee onto tenants knowing they can. the root of all this is that brokers need their broker fee and know that there’s so much competition for broker in the market that if they try to charge landlords their fee, that the landlord will just find another broker who won’t charge the fee to the landlord. it’s a disturbing practice and one i won’t participate in. broker fees and the rent itself is crazy. i’m in an old rent stabilized apartment now, really want to move into something newer. don’t think it’s feasible 😅 for people pay rent over $2k. how much do you make? i recently got an entry level full time position with a nyc government agency yet i still can’t find an apartment that costs less than a third of my monthly income, which is why like many nyc natives i’m still living with my parents in our dinky queens apartment. grateful for them but to say i’m getting hopeless of my dream to raise my kids in this city is to say the least. lol yes. we were lucky to find a two bedroom. however, since then, the building’s been broken into and my road bike was stolen (looked straight out of a movie), we had a ridiculous steam leak in the fall (similar to one that devastatingly killed an infant in brooklyn), and the landlord/mgmt company still has not fixed all the damage from the leak.   wildly, we might be forced into staying here for yet another year because it is so expensive to move. we’d pay $1,000+ more than we already do per month for most comparable situations, including 1 brs. our only requirement is shared laundry and somewhat easy access to a park :’) even if i could afford to move, i'd be intimidated by the process of finding an apartment. my mom is a senior on a fixed income living with my brother who is mentally disabled she can’t afford to move out of her apartment. i can’t afford to help her. the landlord barely does anything to fix any issues in the 2 flat is literally falling apart. we hate this landlord but she can’t move out yes!  i’m stuck where i am renting even though i can find more affordable rent. i am a working professional union artist. because most of my work is freelance and even though i make 40x the rent, i am still denied because my income isn’t proven.   and don’t get me started on these management companies. it’s like talking to chat gpt once every 3 business weeks. it feels like my income is being run through the same algorithm that is artificially inflating rent on zillow/streeteasy. and if the numbers don’t check out for a certain % profit every year then you’re denied.  i lived above a single landlord owner in a brownstone in brooklyn and it was great. it was a human to human connection without the mass exploitation of renters these days. plus high taxes. plus artificial inflation. it's too much.  and before someone comes for me about supply and demand, start with the corporate landlords who are artificially inflating rent by leaving thousands of apartments empty. yes! it feels almost like paying a down payment between the first months, security deposit, and the brokers fee. especially for apartments that you find through street easy and zillow. if the brokers fee won’t be removed in nyc it should at least be evenly split between the tenant and the landlord. i’ve only lived in the city for one year and sadly might move out because of how hard it is to find a place.   i make less than 100k (but close), but have an extremely healthy savings account that i built up for over 2.5 years by living at home. nobody wants to rent to me or even get back to me. my parents are offering to co-sign/guarantor the apartment, which is not a problem in any other state but it’s like saying a forbidden word here when searching for a place. they make well over the 80x requirement too and will give me extra money as help (which makes me feel guilty but also so appreciate it  i just don’t understand it. i could literally pay my rent up front but nobody wants to even consider a peasant (ha) such as myself. i’ve lived in 5 other states and this place is by far the hardest to find housing due to all these requirements. the fee comes out to be 1.5x more than a month of rent and considering the fact that the extent of listing agent work is opening the door and emailing you maybe 2-3 times, how can anyone have respect for these guys? they bring limited to zero value to the transaction. glorified key holders.  just this week, i had a broker pull out his email on his phone and scroll through all of the showing requests he’d received for this listing to demonstrate that my partner and i were up against “potentially wealthy” applicants that “the landlord might prefer over others.” worse was that he told us his fee was 12% a year’s rent all while standing in front of us wearing stained pajamas — he didn’t live in the building, he just showed up like this.  i’ve decided that if i’m going to have to grit my teeth and pay the brokers fee at some point, i’m going to “hire” one that i like/trust and that is going to actually advocate for me and not just throw my app in with the rest of them.   you can “hire” as many agents you want, there’s no law against it. the good ones will take the time to learn what you want, consult you on the process, and lean on their re/brokerage connections to get you a place that you’re not settling on. compass, corcoran, and serhant are my go tos.  the city doesn’t give a shit about us and caved to rebny pressure in 2020 and now we’re getting squeezed dry. short of draconian measures, this is how it’s going to be until incremental policy changes are adopted.  the only real power we have in this anymore is that we can make these guys work for their supper. absolutely. its possible to move cause i know someone who knows housing front to back in their head but   its only for semi ghettoish areas  and youll have to find a bunch of roommates to fill the small rooms to satisfy the renter  because they only believe it makes sense best to have all the housemates be associated with one another  vetting process would be too hard if everyone was not associated or acquainted  not sure if the migrant crisis is also indirectly being scapegoated  honestly the lawmaker and policy fools in politics are the ones controlling things  its out of the voters hands  theres too much red tape and money under the table so laws arent kept in place to control the rent in a reasonable way without screwing the landlords who need to make money after inflation it's like 8-10k to move lmao yes. my landlord is increasing the rent 5% after just one year despite the apartment having significant maintenance issues (including a plumber having to come 12 times). the apartment is already incredibly expensive and at the top of our budget.   however, we crunched the numbers and it's just not worth it to move. between first months rent, one month security, a 15% brokers fee and the chance you may have to overlap by a few weeks in order to find a new place, the costs don't justify the move.   i'll add that my husband and i both have very good jobs and salaries, and we're still struggling. it's a problem. i cant move because everything that was affordable to me went up $200-$500 in the last few years because of greed. looking at the price history of a lot of these places is the most depressing thing imaginable. i could've had a place by now 2 years ago but now thats impossible due to my income. yes! i want to move but cannot, between moving expenses and brokers fee, and a new lease for an apt that won’t be as nice as mine and probably will be more expensive. as a single person i’m hanging on to my 1 br tightly with both hands. shameless plug here, i work for a company that provides a waiver on behalf of renters in place of a lump sum security deposit.  look for obligo partner landlords, or ask your property manager if that is an option they offer. yes. and then there are the companies who offer “$0 deposit” but instead hook you into monthly plans with insurance broker fees are the most ridiculous thing ever this is my fiancé and me almost every year- when we're hit with massive rent increases and have to weigh if it's worth it to move or not. last year we chose an apt simply because there was no brokers fee and he was able to leave work to see it the very day it was posted and put our deposit down within hours of it going live.   we missed so many other no brokers fee options just because everyone wants them and they're usually showing in the mornings or daytime which is usually impossible for us to go to. we considered one other apt so much and loved it so much but it was 25% of the annual rent and my half would've destroyed my savings. it's a hot, stressful mess and i feel like we're stuck in this apt this year even if they raise the rent because we just cantttt go through this stressful process again! it was never cheap to move, it's just a little harder now because the cost of housing is absurdly high i moved into my current building in manhattan in 2019 and paid a one month broker fee. in 2021 i moved to a different apartment (same size) in the same building because i needed more sunlight. the new apartment was $150 less than the previous one (probably because it was a lower floor).  in 2022, my rent went up 10% which hurt a lot. i know compared to others in the city, that 10% is low for that year's increases, but still ouch. they wouldn't negotiate it down, but they did lock it in for two years.  my lease is up this summer. i am terrified at what the increase is going to be. last time i looked at my landlord's website, a similar-sized apartment was about 15% more than what i'm paying.   i'm looking at brooklyn, and queens (i work in queens) but i'm not sure how much money i'd save moving with how prices are. absolutely. i was forced out of my apartment by a jerk landlord gave me less than 3 weeks notice that he wanted to live in my apt. now looking for a new place but can’t afford the 15% broker fee, moving costs, plus first and security deposit. it ends up being close to $10k up front. i feel like i’ll never be able to move back to the city. yes. my partner and i are looking to move out of our apartment due to pests and water damage from a leaky bathroom ceiling pipe and another pipe in the same ceiling that burst), but we are struggling to find a place we can afford. my lease is currently about $500 higher than market rent and i can’t wait to get out of it, personally.   i could legitimately move into a nearly identical no fee apartment for $450 less than i am currently paying today if i could exit my lease. renewed this past july/august. i work for a brokerage and can easily acknowledge how out of hand housing has gotten in recent years i feel this as well. living in the bay area of california we were priced out when we got pregnant - not two students or anything, two professionals in their 30s were priced out of nyc and had to move to nj. like come on. 1bedroom with 2 kids. want a 2bdr but too expensive and don't want to give up rent stabilization. yes, i’m a software engineer and consider myself wealthy (8 years of expenses saved up), but that goes down to nearly 3 if i were to move to nyc. an hour away by train is the next best option. it's always been my dream to move into the boros but between it being so difficult to find a job and the absurd prices it's never gonna happen for me. unless i can get a job for next year at a decent brooklyn school and my friend gets a job with a company here and we can be room mates it's never gonna happen. yes this recently was almost and issue. was the difference between being stuck w roommates another year vs living alone i still cringe i paid a woman 3k to text me a number of the super so i can go see an apartment. why? this is worth an investigation - the prices are not only exorbitant, but landlords are taking advantage of gray areas around things like rhino and charging extra amounts that are technically illegal. when i moved i had to pay 1st month, security, brokers fee and a rhino policy. it’s illegal to charge more than 1 month of security deposit but because rhino isn’t regulated, they managed to force me to do it. i had no choice because i needed a place to live asap so i had to pay. my landlord is a huge company too, it’s not even like it’s a single scammy person. the last time my least was up in may i did the math. movers and brokers fee, plus some small overlap in renting two places totaled what would have been a 15% increase in rent over one year. rent increase came in at 12%, so i stayed. but realizing how stuck i am isn’t fun. would have to move to a much cheaper area or out of state to make it make sense money-wise. yes!! rent is crazy high expensive, i’ve been waiting for two years to move out of my dads house, (we live in a townhouse, i live in the basement which is not bad, “i have my own privacy”, but i can’t bring people over, can’t be naked obviously, etc…) i’ve been on the lookout on winters because apparently rent tends to go down or at least stay the same (according to a few real state agents that i know) but it’s sooo hard, specially if you are looking to live by yourself (an experience that i’ve always wanted) having a roommate can be very tricky… for me in special because i am from another country and have different culture habits, like cleaning wise and cooking very often… i honestly do not know what to do, good luck!! as a disabled/autistic new yorker- i feel depressed how it’s virtually impossible to move into my own apartment someday. i live in supportive living but dream of living in a one bedroom apartment someday. i’m almost 30 and the housing stipend i get won’t cover the full cost of an apartment anywhere plus it doesn’t cover any security deposit or broker fees. the program i’m in called self direction requires you to pay the rent then get reimbursed which i can only do if my parents pay it for me because i’m limited to $2,000 in my bank account for medicaid/social security. i feel like i’m stuck in a more restrictive environment than i need to be in because of this. i know the areas i’d want to live manhattan very well and am also very familiar with some areas in brooklyn but i don’t think i’ll ever be able to afford a place in where i’m comfortable. after months of searching finally found my “dream apartment” (which was still well over 4k for like 650 square feet) only to then hear that there was a 15% brokers fee. that’s nearly $8,000. and for what exactly???? i’m the one who’s been busting my ass touring and finding these listings online myself. ridiculous. same when i owned co-ops in queens. want to buy another one? 20% down plus cash in the bank and have to sell your old one and need 10% down at contract yal do realize that new york is 1 out of 50 states in america...if you can't find a place in ny, move. lived in nyc for 3 years. needed like $5k upfront to move. been in atl for 4 years now and the cost is significantly lower and the apartments are much nicer. the most i've paid in a deposit in atl is $300. nothing more. broker fees aren't a thing here. i would love to move but i can’t afford the broker fees it’s pretty bad. i live with a roommate stranger lol… it’s time to eliminate brokers sent ! i might be able to give some insight - i also and pretty aware of cost of living in dc/boston where i've also lived a few years each if you want a nuanced or comparative perspective.   i'll never afford manhattan and it is increasingly harder to find something with good proximity to it in the boroughs. i’ll add in that since new york apartments are so tiny and oddly shaped at times, it’s so difficult to find another place that will fit your furniture, so buying new furniture gets added to the long list of costs with moving. i really want to move out of my studio this summer but i'm terrified of the process/available inventory and i don't know if i can afford the 10k upfront costs (this isn't even including a broker fee which i refuse). considering just packing it up and putting everything in storage even though my entire professional career is here and i work on site a couple days a week. i've been living here for 9 years. will do broker fees are seriously a thing again? if you want to move to a studio or 1 bedroom apartment in manhattan more often than not you will have to come up with nearly 10k on the first month. it’s absolutely absurd that brokers even receive a fee most times. i’ve been on several tours where brokers can’t even answer basic questions such as laundry options, who the service provider is, etc. they just expect you to show up and sign the lease and hand them 15%  application fee ~ 50+ broker fee (15% of annual rent) ~ 4500+  security deposit  ~ 2500+ first months rent ~ 2500+ i moved to nyc from atlanta to help my parents (mom has dementia) i use a wheelchair (paraplegic) and i needed to find an apartment in manhattan so i could easily get back and forth to my parents since they live there and i can’t rely on the subway to get from another borough to manhattan because most are not accessible.  i had to move from a 1700 sq foot open lift that had accommodations for my wheelchair, and free parking, to a 400 sq foot studio with limited accommodations and no parking.  i gave away most of my furniture and now just have my bed and a very small table out - the rest of the studio is just full of boxes of books, curios, souvenirs, from my life.   i refer to my apartment as my storage room with a bed.   i spent a full week in august looking for an apartment but could not find any that met my needs and within a reasonable price. i had limited options because i cannot use a walk up apartment and those elevator buildings that were built before 1995 or so have bathrooms that are too small to accommodate a wheelchair. i went to a lot of no fee apartment buildings that advertised open apartments on streeteasy, and would make appointments, but by the time i got there all of the apartments were gone.  used a broker the last day but did not fully understand the concept of a “brokers fee” until i decided on one of the apartments he showed me and then got a ridiculous bill for just a couple of hours work on his side.  things are stacked on the landlord’s side - like making me sign an online lease ahead of time and having me sign each page - including things they knew were a lie (like confirming that the building superintendent had showed me the apartment and all of its safety features even though i had never met him and no one showed me the safety features or having me sign parts of the lease that were not in english so i could not confirm what i was signing).  and then the pressure to get the security deposit, get the brokers fee.  ugh.   i grew up in nyc, love the vibrancy of the city and the diversity of the people, but once my parents meet their great reward i will be moving out.   maybe i strayed from the topic a little - sorry about that!  just had to vent on how hard and expensive it is to find an apartment.  also - yes, i would like to move to riverdale or nj and then drive into the city once a week to help with my parents but not sure the juice is worth the squeeze on moving because of what i went through. im a cook and i worked at a decent restaurant i walked out of my job last night from the stress of moving and not having a place now im gonna have to go out of state cause its just not worth it to me spending the couple grand i finally saved on living expenses just to continue the rat race my friend told their landlord they were moving at the end of their lease but that knew someone (me) interested in taking the apartment. ll agreed, on the condition that i pay a commission fee of 1 month’s rent. their own tenant literally did the ‘work’ of finding a replacement tenant 3 months before end of lease & i still had to pay the equiv of a broker fee 😭 it’s likely do to the politics. was it like this five years ago? currently moving, been denied twice with perfect credit score and over 60x salary. nyc is no man’s land with renting. this is coming from some who got approved within 2 days of applying for my nashville apartment. currently moving, been denied twice with perfect credit score and over 60x salary. nyc is no man’s land with renting. this is coming from some who got approved within 2 days of applying for my nashville apartment. depends on how you move.   in my case, i. refuse to use a broker because i've always know that they're thieves.  i'm 54 now and got my first apartment when i was 19.   the very first broker that i met would be the last time i used one.   never again.  the best thing you can do is find your own place. deal with the owner directly.  the reason people are renters in the first place is because they don't have a lot of upfront money.  paying 4 times the rent plus other moving expenses is ridiculous the only way to get affordable housing in nyc is pure luck and determination.  anytime someone asks me for tips - i don’t have any. i luckily got a rent stabilized place during covid that i will never leave, unless i become lucky again. i wonder why?  https://preview.redd.it/nb9g5vw5lzgc1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be9a2ab84d90b2e9e65a36c4e0b7cbaee08e8667",497,250,negative,0.8559792637825012,747,"we were shocked to see the fees we would have to pay. we were also appalled when we saw the fees we would have to pay: broker fees, security deposit, application fee, and more. we are now looking to move to a larger apartment because we are pregnant and wanted more storage space. we were shocked to see the fees we would have to pay. we are now looking to move to a smaller apartment because we are pregnant and wanted more space. we are"

20,Did not renew my $2.4K/mo 1BR in Hells Kitchen because the new lease is $3.2K. Found out after moving the new lease is $2.5K.,"is this building on the corner of 39th & 9th ave, above an italian restaurant? because the same exact thing happened to me in december/january how long has it been since you moved? is it possible they thought they could get 3.2 but dropped back down when they weren’t getting bites? do brokers get their broker fee for renewing leases, or are they incentivized to kick out tenants and get new ones in each year? thats brutal. sorry op. it’s blackwater. everyone who works there is fucking evil. unfortunately this is not uncommon practice in nyc/nj - it’s happened to me and my friends before, and directly from building managements (not via brokers.) usually they try to hike the rent up hoping you’d bite to avoid the cost of moving, but then will decrease it as time goes by and no new tenants agree to pay that much. new tenants will be asked to pay $3.5k next year. landlords know most people don't want to move and will make you pay for that security. this is how they get you - lure you in with one price and then jack up the price the next year hoping you don't want to move. the new tenants are going to get a huge jump next year as well.   the management company is cool with churning tenants with low rents for a few years until they reel in that one sucker that pays the elevated rent for 5-10 years.   if it makes you feel any better, you were never going to get a $2.5k offer. are you a shitty and/or needy tenant?  maybe they just wanted you out. do you know if your building is covered by the new good cause eviction law? it's kind of complicated and i don't understand it that well, also i guess maybe no longer applicable now that you've moved out, but maybe worth looking into? https://www.nixonpeabody.com/insights/alerts/2024/04/22/new-york-enacts-good-cause-eviction-law how is that considered 1 br??? that’s cruel did you check [hpd](https://hpdonline.nyc.gov/hpdonline/) to see if your building is rent stabilized? that would’ve been my first move. you could also reach out to [dchr](https://apps.hcr.ny.gov/buildingsearch/?tspd_101_r0=084c043756ab2000c1528c86eeed4902dbc8a966b908584109c13ec7e8c2e022745c82f11aca127f084779cb6d143000d478694ade746b56d561637154d0bb7c2f21c3ba3ce319513152e578e56d7fe8d4b42dbff98861aa08e63e939cb1192b) to get detailed rental history and confirmation of rent stabilized status for your specific unit. my times is coming up in 3 months. i am scared shitless when reading this ! i will go through this every year unfortunately . this is why i’ll never use a broker to rent an apt in nyc again. just search for “no fee” on streeteasy. have done this with 4 apartments now. there is a very good chance this apartment is rent stabilized. at the current rent, it seems highly unlikely it would have been deregulated. hey, is your apartment rent stabilized? you may find out by going to https://amirentstabilized.com/ and getting your rent history mailed to you before you move out.   if yes, then the landlord may be required to allow you to renew your lease with an increase that the rent guidelines board decides https://rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us/  also, there was a new law that passed about good cause eviction https://www.nixonpeabody.com/insights/alerts/2024/04/22/new-york-enacts-good-cause-eviction-law the answer might be that some of the broker fee is kicked back to the landlord. how is this legal after the good cause eviction laws passed? price fixing might be at play here. the landlords have software that shares rent prices how many apartments to leave empty to get the highest profit. something similar happened to my gf as well. when she first signed the lease it was 2500. then she got the renewal lease and it was 2300 and she was like wtf. as it turns out there was an “error” and the original rent was suppose to be $2200. the property manager was like ops we screwed up and gave her a credit for the“overcharged” amount so she basically doesn’t need to pay rent for the last 2 months. but the broker fee? nah she’s not getting that back. brokers are scammers definitely slimy piece of shit https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/d5603aqhldkaewnveva/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1663699448704?e=1724889600&v=beta&t=4r2zygdute3whuprc5wggmyzgmozgru-renraqqetpc do you still have a copy of the renewal contract?   you should talk to fair housing in the city. if you feel at all like the pushing you out had something to do with a protected class (race, disability (including emotional support animal), gender/sexual orientation, national origin, religion) you would be able to try to make a fair housing case. obviously you should only pursue this if you really think it is the potential cause of you being pushed out. feel free to ask any questions if so, i work in fair housing.  sounds as though this guy may just….suck :( i’m confused.  after renting the apartment and being there for a year, wouldn’t you negotiate the new lease with the landlord?? why is the broker involved? off topic but where did you get your desk? its hella cute think of it this way, if you stayed you probably would have gotten ridiculous increases every year, so might as well leave since the ll is greedy. that’s a bad guy. i know he’s involved scamming others. you likely got played so he could earn some extra money. this happened to me in my previous building. they offered a new lease that was an insanely high price then ended up renting my unit out for a bit lower than what i had been paying. it was so disappointing but i’ve heard it’s common. happened to me to in bpc.  tried negotiating with management but they wouldn’t budge- saw it rented few months later on street easy for less than i was paying.  two years later they remodelled apartment and listed for what i was paying!  infuriating. might have been malicious, stupidity, or the algorithm was off could just be business model that some apartment owners started implementing. fill apartment at cheap rent, raise rent in hopes that hassle of moving makes tenant pay above market, then profit. if a tenant won’t play that game, they leave and apartment owner starts game over with new tenant. i would be livid. i’d be calling the building and the brokers boss average broker. leaches that provide nothing to society. as someone who shifted from ny to nj i can tell you the practice is extremely common. the majority of these places are prioritizing tenancy turnover to inflate their rent. my apartment (in nj) went up $300 every year, no one as far as i know besides the rich ones stay longer than 1-2 because it becomes inoperable. ny has something similar since there are so many of us looking for places we get these really ridiculous bargains because they can “always replace you.” good on you for finding a place in nj, welcome aboard. i anticipate all of us will be dealing with this type of madness and finding ourselves constantly moving until the market crashes and landlords stop acting like greedy a**holes. > david m. warner from blackwater associates  i just avoid his properties like the plague. i saw 1 listing of theirs and 1 was more than enough. they had a 1bd/1ba in kips bay listed at $2.9k, but they loved dragging their feet on getting applications, couldn't be arsed to show the apartment at the open house (a whole bunch of us waited to 15-20m+ for the super to let us in), but somehow had the gall to circle back a week+ later to ask ""how did you like the apartment? 🥰 do you want to apply?"" i can tell you that he probably made more than 15%. i toured an apartment last year and broker fee was 21% is it possible broker might’ve not making his commission unless a new tenants occupies the space ? its a shame that there are a lot of people within this post that have had bad experiences with david m. warner of blackwater associates. they should really look into their practices if a lot of people are calling them out on it. newark? omg. i’d die. this is also my building’s policy. new tenants get lower rents as an incentive to get them to come in but then they’ll increase the rent for tenants that stay. it’s ass backwards in my opinion. my old building was the opposite. once your rent reaches $2500 in nyc , it’s no longer under rent control. so they can raise it by 2k if they want.  i had a similar situation. i lived at a place for 10+ years . i was at 2450, then they raised it to 2900.  i spoke to the landlord and he said “the fast you’re out, the faster i can increase rent”…..  these guys are slime balls no reason to live in manhattan unless working in manhattan, preferably at a hig pying job damn… playa got played. um… are you sure you weren’t rent stabilized or protected by the good cause eviction law? the broker explanation sound no to convincing. bidding wars for apartments? these landlords deserve prison time. david warner is horrible! he has tried scare tactics with every tenant in our building, sends checks that bounce, lies about rent regulations and lies constantly about rent being paid. the owner of the building mike rhabar is not better. reminder: if you live in a market rate unit you can and should negotiate your renewal leases. the landlord doesn’t like when people move out, even if the broker would prefer it. plz newark is 5778 safer than nyc [deleted] you are an unwanted tenant they wanted you out. you were a pain in the azz and they had enough. life’s not fair unfortunately. move on",493,136,negative,0.7361827492713928,629,?

22,DO NOT ever rent a room at 315 W 102nd Street from the woman PL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.,"crazy. thanks for spilling holy! thank you for sharing. glad you were able to get out of there! hopefully google indexes this so this post shows up when you google the address. i lived around the block on w 103rd and even i knew about her!! holy shit. this is one of the craziest things i have ever heard on reddit i’m so so sorry. get out safely write about this on openigloo.com it will greatly help! cheers to you for sharing. a bad apartment experience can really have someone hating this city and their life. similar situation happened to me renting a room in south slope. left after 4 days though. lost my whole rent and deposit lol. i live two blocks away and am intrigued!  i will be looking at certain stranger a little more closely now! [removed] these actions are surprising, but not shocking. this sounds like something that would be from the onion or best of craigslist. is it possible to say ""two can play that game"" and give her the same type of treatment whilst covering your tracks? obviously i won't be living there, but in my head fantasy, i imagine myself getting revenge by stooping to her level and seeing just who is willing to out-crazy the other... (it would definitely be her since i have too much to lose, but it's a fun day dream) wow.  thanks for sharing.  glad you got out while you could.  geez this lady is something. wow o [removed] honestly, i’m more horrified that you posted so publicly who your source for all of this was and that you have already doxed them by giving out the building address. i guess since you’re no longer living there it ain’t your problem what happens to them as a result of your actions, amiright? you’ve endangered their job and put them in the line of fire after they were kind to you. my question is why would you choose to live with an elderly lady geez, this is insane. did you ask her for her linkedin profile first before you decided to live with her? holy shiy those privledges new yorkers ivtell ya",453,52,negative,0.6250532865524292,505,i know her. ivtell ya ivtell ya ivtell ya ivtell ya ivtell ya ivtell ya ivtell yai know about her. holy! holyshit is shit i’m so! i hope thanks for sharing i
23,Broker wants 40% LOL,"i suggest the broker post this message on r/circlejerknyc i suggest he fuck right off lol i would never have it in me to give more than the months rent. but i’m also never home. i have many suggestions for the broker none of which should be in writing. 40 percent of annual rent. unbelievable suggested? offer 15% suggested? name and shame. sir, i don’t know where you got the audacity, but you need to put it right back. sounds like they are trying to bypass the governors recent actions against high fees. if you are the one “offering” it, they might be off the hook welp this is actually illegal so you may want to report the broker. they are basically prioritizing how applications are submitted based on how much you're willing to pay them. please have their license revoked. broker is definitely splitting it with landlord or management hahaha how cheap is it? i’ve heard about this being the case for super cheap places. it’s still bullshit but if you’re saving like $10k a year and stay for 5 years… worth considering. that said brokers fees are bullshit and the owner should pay them. i know for a fact a few of the brokers are bribed here in queens. it’s terrible i bet if you look up the address you could find the landlord and possibly contact them. most landlords dont  want to deal with realtor scumbags either so you might be able to strike a deal directly with them aka no brokers fee. good luck this shit really needs to be illegal this is what happens when the city/government passes half ass regulations without understanding the industry. (or intentionally leaves loopholes).   rent stabilized units are supposed to give tenants affordable options but instead are exploited by some industry professionals(lol).  cap the broker fee, provide better regulations around rent stabilization, standardize the whole industry from head to toe then we will have a more normal, transparent and functioning market. scam alert the fact y'all have to pay a broker to find y'all apartments in nyc is so crazy to me, but i guess it makes sense with nyc's sheer population size and competition. suggest my ass speaking honestly, that seems like a red flag… but the rent stability is really nice! wishing you well op, and congrats on your new home whenever and wherever you land :) how is the broker scam in new york not illegal yet. insanity. oh my goodness 🫣 what! lmfao 😂 you know you can report them to dos assuming 2k a month, 24k annually, running a 9.6k fee? gtfo. sounds like it’s being rented by owner and they are trying to get an extra fee tell him you could offer him a suggestion on a new career because that’s crazy chi ossé is trying to make this illegal. drop their name, so people can avoid doing business with them offer $0 rent stabilized means nothing if you are paying a premium of 40%. just another loophole this is extortion. if you don’t pay it and someone else does, your app goes to the bottom of the pile… i saw this apartment too! definitely the same one. there was a crazy long line to see the apartment and they wouldn’t answer any questions at the showing just made people reach out to an email/phone number if interested. it’s a lovely neighborhood but this whole thing implies that whoever offers the highest broker’s fee will get the lease. i refuse to participate in this, it’s disgusting wait, am i understanding this correctly? the landlord hires a broker to find tenants and the tenant then has to pay the broker a large percentage?  sorry, i live in michigan not nyc (never even been to nyc, though i’d like to see it once) so i don’t know why this popped up for me but now i’m curious. i don't know why reddit suggested this sub as i live in colorado, but this thread is insane.  apartment brokers? you need to report this idiot.  i would also share their information on here and all social media so they never get any work again.  this behavior is not true of all realtors.   just this ahole. sounds like snake oil is the neighborhood that worth it? you might as well find a nicer place in the same neighborhood with a normal fee. wow… i’m paying 11% after being strung along for two months by broker and owner after they discovered lead and had to do the kitchen. initially move in was aug. 8 finally getting in oct. 3 oh and don’t forget the added $200 /mo for the kitchen upgrade. fuckin criminals  clarification: the 11% is based on initial rent price so there’s that’s 🙄 yo send me a link to that listing bro lol fourty. percent. what. the. fuck. omg absolutely not! you're unrepresented? counter 15% to be competitive but tbh you should say 1 month because typically in my experience, if the ll is only paying their own agent's brokerage, that's what they would get anyway. but 40%? this mfer is the kind.of.the agent who gives all of us a bad name. gross! oh this is insane! pls tell them hell naw i live in a new building that is rent stabilized and paid no broker fee, i would not pay that. the (as of now) caught my attention so i googled.  appears it's only extended by 3 more years --wondering if there are rumblings about removing it?   https://council.nyc.gov/press/2024/03/19/2576/ is this the listing broker? how much is the rent? brokers fees are criminal if it’s a really cheap apt (like $1000 a month) then it might be worth it… just saying. but also if it’s bidding just offer what you feel comfortable with. if you don’t get the apt you’ll know you put your best offer. if you offer something you don’t feel good about and get it then that’s worse in my opinion. but also reading other comments if it’s a run down apartment it’s probably not worth it even if it’s in a good neighborhood. if they won’t come down in the fee try contacting rebny, or their brokerage or even dos. the brokers fee is always negotiable and that’s one of the first things you learn when you get your license. also it’s their fiduciary responsibility to report all offers to their client (aka landlord) should they not tell the seller on your intent to rent or block you, you have two cases on them. is this actually a licensed broker i asked a broker if the fee was negotiable (asked for 15%) and he told me in a suuuper cunty voice “i suggest you search for an apartment and not a realtor fee” and hung up. what a twat offer 0.40% [deleted] didn’t the law change..? best i can do is $20. that’s an insane percentage. granted i think a percentage of rent is complete bs anyway. not only is it tacky af but it’s also illegal i'll take a different approach.  how much under market is this apartment, and how long would you guess you would live there?  depending on your answers, i might go against the grain. that's 40% too high i would offer that they eat shit and die. suggested? is this an optional tipping system?  i’d rather pay more rent than give 40% of annual rent to a broker what’s the rent ? as a woman born and bred in nyc, the only response is s.m.d! it's rent stabilized.  someone will probably pay it, and it might be a great deal long term. 40% of annual could be 12-30k in nyc, holy shit get lost. fuck this. my daughter wants to move to nyc- i’ve never rented there. wtf is a brokers fee? (i googled but i still don’t understand the necessity and could use some info) after submitting an application 😆 suggested brokers fee is a punch in the face. depends on how cheap the apartment is. i’d this an amazing deal? 40% of annual is wild. why aren’t u applying to no fee apts ? scam! 15% or walk i will never again pay a brokers fee. fuck these people. that’s unethical. 15% is max yes, they are asking for bribes. and yes, it's legal.   nyc brokers have a monopoly on renters' bribes. they are the only ones who can extort money legally and give the apartment to the applicant who offers the highest fee.  for everyone else, this is called ""key money"" and it's illegal.     key money is an upfront payment made to a landlord, or tenant to secure a rental property.      examples of key money:  * **upfront payment for rent-stabilized unit**: a landlord asks for $5,000 upfront to secure a below-market-rate rent-stabilized apartment. * **fee to bypass broker**: a landlord charges a $3,000 fee to rent directly without involving a broker. * **“transfer” payment from tenant**: a current tenant asks for $2,000 to ""transfer"" their rent-controlled lease to a new tenant. * **""renovation fee"" for access**: a landlord charges $10,000 labeled as a ""renovation fee,"" but it’s actually key money for securing the apartment.     above $1000, key money is a felony.     somehow, rebny and the real estate lobby convinced lawmakers that brokers giving the apartment to the highest bidder don't fit this category. 1$ that’s fucking r*pe. fuck that all i have is five cents for you opening the door lol, gotta love finding speds like u/ordinary-lobster-710 who is so confidant in being wrong that they block you. it’s a shame such wrong info is spread on reddit, especially when op needs actual help. this very much reads as a scam. dont even bother considering. if it’s $1,000/mo then 40% would be $4800. it’s still steep, especially if you’re only able to afford in that $1k  range, but…. if it were at market rate the rent would probably be $3,500 so they could be seen as asking something like 1.5 month for their broker fee. but yeah, it sounds like they’re just kind of auctioning the apt with their fee. i had the same thing happen to me. they were also asking to basically bid on what we’d pay on the rent, which is illegal with rent stabilized. really wanted the apartment though. spoke to friends who are real estate agents and they agreed it was illegal, but said if you want the apartment you gotta play ball.  we begrudgingly offered more for the rent and brokers fee, figuring we could fix the rent issue after we were in. they narrowed it down to us and two other parties. we didn’t get it. we now live a block away and are still annoyed. it was 1k less in rent than we are paying, i wish i had offered more. either way it’s so slimy. no respect for realty collective that represented the property. i've never heard of a scam like this. run who is this broker? put them on blast. so illegal and immoral what they are doing. this is how you get cheap places in nyc. yes a month is the customary brokers fee but i know someone who paid 3 months and now they have a huge 3 bedroom in a nice place in bk for very very cheap.   i don’t think it’s a good system for allocating affordable apts but this is not unheard of for very desirable neighborhoods in manhattan. might as well make it 100% a joke smh i feel like a european hearing about american tipping culture do your real estate agents really have the audacity to ask for a 40% tip of you buying something you already need to buy anyways? you don’t need to pay these just go to the buildings leasing office and pay nothing sounds like scam this is disgusting but also you should do the math and see if the monthly rent is low enough to be worth it. they’re basically asking you to do a bribe bidding war, but without revealing the amount anyone else is willing to bribe. assuming you’re sure it’s not a straight up scam (which you should always be wary of) figure out what amount you’d be willing to pay that would be worth it and offer that. and if they say someone has a bigger bribe than that then walk away. don’t let them pressure you with like 1000 more and it’s yours. broker looking to counter w the well i have another client who’s willing to pay 50%, that’s not unreasonable around here…  if you want it you better sign the contracts and lease before she/he does…blah blah we had a similar experience. broker tried to charge 25%, they justified because of ""all the money we'd be paying having a rent controlled apartment.""  many brokers don't even show up to the appointments; we arrive and they give us a building code or the janitor lets us in, and the broker texts afterwards asking for our opinions.  these people are a scourge. broker what?",439,226,negative,0.6915555000305176,665,i suggest you report this idiot. this is not all realtors. just this ahole. this is not illegal. this is not even legal. this is just extortion. this is not even legal. this is just a scam. i would suggest you report this idiot. i would also suggest you report them to dos. this is not legal. this is just stupid. i would suggest you find another place. i would suggest you
24,Verizon technician washed my dishes,"you need to start having internet issues when the sink is full and laundry covering the floor.  be smart about this! i gotta book a fios appointment…. a man who you didn’t have to beg to do mundane household tasks? and in a house they don’t live in or sleep with anybody in?  marry them lol jk he had to run the lines through the drain and the dishes were in the way. i wonder if we had the same fios guy come run a line and set stuff up. i have shelves in my bathroom for all my skin and hair care and when fios guy asked to use my bathroom he went in and organized everything by size and turned the stuff so the labels were facing forward. weird my verizon tech came and got his muddy boots all over my rugs please send him over my way. maybe he can wash the dishes that have been in the sink since friday this is the best usage of ocd i’ve read.  i love it. omg, i wonder if he vacuums too! lol. i had a tech come once and take a stinky dump in my bathroom.  dishes sound like a welcome alternative 😭 maybe his hands were dirty and while washing them he got the plates gross so washed them too? did you get the tech’s name and number?   i don’t think they offer fios in my building, but i think i need that tech to come out to my apartment to investigate the situation personally so i can be absolutely sure. r/benignexistence would like this that's wild, but for how much verizon charges and how much i don't enjoy washing dishes, i would not complain. 😂 next time leave a cookbook open and see if he whips up dinner too last time the spectrum guy took a piss in my bathroom with the door open. maybe it's time to switch to verizon. these fios techs are the best. at my last place, i asked for the ont box to be placed in a weird area across the entire apartment from where the fiber optic is, and he routed the whole thing around moulding and door frames and drilled through certain walls to make it work. the work looked so clean and amazing and i tried to tip him but he refused it.  in contrast at my new place i had a spectrum dude come through and asked him to nail down the loose cable that stretched across my apt and he said he doesn't do that and provided me with the clips and said i can do it myself where was this??? that’s nice send him to my house next please i've only ever had them clean my pipes. he probably wanted a glass of water, rinsed the cup and figured he'd be nice and do the rest since there wasn't many? my dog walker did my dishes a couple times. bless her heart. i love this!!! nyc version techs are the best! once when my internet was down, the repairman realized he didn’t have the part he needed. sop would have been to reschedule for another day (and be stuck inside during the appointment “window”). however, my repairman said “oh! hang on… i think there’s a tech a few blocks away that may have it. so he walkie-talkie-d him, and zipped out of my flat, back in less than 5 minutes (and it was a hot day!), and fixed the problem in less than 5 minutes!  if you can, try to contact the tech’s supervisor and wax poetic about what a fantastic job the tech did. (maybe without even mentioning the dishes.) that was a husband audition. that's so sweet. he likes you. i see you've met one of my fellow kindred ocd spirits. it's compulsive, please understand. i am reading this and assuming this was a little awkward but kind verizon tech that found you attractive and didn’t know what to do about it.  so he did your dishes for you. lol.   just a theory but it is kind of really sweet when you turn off the part of your brain that looks at it as absurd and strange. i had a cable installer play with my dog for like two hours while he was stuck at my place waiting for my service to be activated. he kept saying, ""man i miss my dog so much,"" and learned that his had passed away a few months prior. my girl was the same breed and color and the installer was in heaven. maybe he got confused when you said you had a dish all jokes aside this is strange. maybe some type of compulsive disorder i'm married to a verizon tech. he would possibly wash a dish or 2. he prides himself on his tidy wiring . he's my hero maybe i’m too cynical but my first thought would be that he peed or vomited in your sink and needed to eliminate the evidence i like to think he experienced a random act of kindness and this is how he decided to pay it forward. was he hot too? sounds like the start of a fan fiction lmao lmfaooo i live in astoria and this happened to me like three years ago. except it wasn’t dishes, he fixed my crooked curtain rods. maybe it was the same fios guy. being kind. there’s always time for good manners, op. this post is supremely confusing to me. are you complaining? common sense or basic knowledge of people's jobs would tell you this was withwr an ""above and beyond"" bonus, or your dirty dishes impeded their work. defaulting to the possibility of the technician having a ""compulsion, etc"" seems auper-karen/chad to me. get over it. you didn't have to do them yourself...how about a little gratitude instead of acting like you were violated.",425,85,neutral,0.4252395927906036,510,tech. he was so sweet. i had a tech come and play with my dog for two hours while he was waiting for my service to be activated. he was so sweet. i had a tech come and play with my dog for two hours while he was waiting for my service to be activated. he was so sweet. i wish i had known that. i wish. i wish. i wish.
25,How does a squatter have more right to a property than the owner?,"an eviction or lock-out that is not authorized by a court and carried out by a marshal is illegal. i'm confused though because they said they had only been there for two days? how does that give them squatters rights? this was a break in more rigorous reporting from the *ny post*... oh wow a $1m house.. oh wait.. that’s like an average price around here.. new york squatter law is ridiculous.  lesson learned. private property can have squatters.  just make sure you have alarm and camera in your house to prevent squatters like this.   same with people who rent your property, if they don't pay rent, they become squatters, and it take time to bring them to court and evict them. anyone justifying the squatter is so concerning. clearly squatter rights should not be a thing. it’s about common sense laws. obviously if it was a tenant paying rent, that’s different and they’d have recourse in court, so using that to justify the squatter is absurd. i saw the video of it earlier today. crazy how they can just break into her house and refuse to leave 🤦‍♂️ she got arrested for breaking the law - hope this helps ah, because new york’s laws are based on absolute stupidity? imagine reading this and siding with the person not paying their bills lmao. the owner should have every right to do whatever they want with their homes. there’s no “late-on-my-car-note rights” that’d prevent dealerships from repossessing a car you don’t pay for. they don’t. the owner decided to do an illegal action and got arrested for doing an illegal action. if the owner had gone to housing court, the matter would have resolved relatively quickly.   it’s not like a typical eviction that can take months. you can get a judgment and warrant pretty easily if those squatters really are squatters.   however, there are many times where a property owner will claim the people in possession are squatters, but the court later learns they aren’t actually squatters but holdover tenants that at one point had a legal right to be there. which is why taking the law into your own hands is punished. the laws have to change. i would understand if a property is abandoned but not if the owner is actively engaged with his property. it’s going to take a year to evict this asshole this is not the sub to post this in... lol. in a few years it'll be illegal in nyc to charge rent so someone could break into your apartment to steal your shit, cops show up and they say ""i live here"" and then what?  they just get to stay? the court system is overwhelming by people taking advantage of landlords. i understand when there is an issue with repairs, but just not paying because you have not money or not make enough is not the landlord's fault!!! nyc needs to resolve rented issues within 2 to 3 months is fair.  nyc is actually letting these people steel money from hard working middle class small landlords. shame on you, nyc, for encouraging this practice!! the city should remove squatters and they can ask for a right to shelter then. at home justice doesnt work. i dont care how upset you are, the squatters have a right to due process, and if a court decides it is legally permissible to kick them out, that’s whatll happen.  vigilante justice is not allowed, so the vigilante property owner was arrested. she can be right in the end but get there in the wrong way, which is what it sounds like happened here see : douglaston squatter die mad, landlord i love the headline. 1m house. dude that's just an average house nowadays. as with most things the law probably started with good intentions but then got taken advantage of by terrible people vote trump. do not vote for these dummy democrats to prevent evil landlords from being evil.

26,New York City Bill Would Mandate Air-Conditioning for Tenants,"i think the heating rules should also be more flexible. my building is very rigid to may 31st even when it's significantly warm before that date a lot of the time. [deleted] hi!  as the city endures its third heat wave of the year, councilman lincoln restler from brooklyn plans to introduce a bill this week that would require landlords to buy, install and maintain air-conditioning units or cooling systems for tenants during the summer, with fines of up to $1,250 per day for noncompliance.  “this will save lives as we reckon with the challenges of the climate crisis,” restler said.  every summer, about 350 new yorkers die from heat-related illnesses, according to the city’s health department. black new yorkers are twice as likely to die from heat as white residents, and a lack of home air-conditioning is a major driver of heat-stress deaths. according to city data, 91% of households had air-conditioning as of 2017.  if the new law passes, buildings would have four years to ensure compliance.  you can read the [~full article for free here~](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/nyregion/new-york-city-air-conditioners.html?unlocked_article_code=1.700.mpoj.hg85zbunyims&smid=re-nytimes), even without a subscription! that’s awesome, too bad it’s never going to happen. this is nice and all, but if con-ed is just gonna run up the charges for tenants to use these, is it really worth it? i hope they include some clause that won’t let landlords charge more rent for then putting the ac, rent is crazy enough as it is maybe mandate them on subway platforms first (or at least indistrial fans, ffs). i’ve seen people pass out while waiting for a train in an underground hotbox a few times. i wonder how that would run up against local law 97 / energy efficiency mandates.  did window ac units count towards energy consumption / green house gas emissions of the building?  did it matter if it was a building wide provided amenity vs individual tenant installed units?  would the increased energy consumption of mandated window ac units (and thus carbon footprint) not count against the building's targets? with climate change, ac is life saving and should be included. power infrastructure in a lot of buildings simply cannot support that mandate without tens even hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of electrical work / upgrades. the poor already can get a free ac. there are  apartments out there with antiquated electricical systems that cannot support an ac. heat in nyc is mainly steam, which doesn't bring the same concerns. i just wonder if that would be a back door way for the landlords to then raise your rent even more. climate change is real. air conditioning is 100 years old. at the very least all new units should have air conditioning. curious if they thought about the electric bill and overwhelming the power grid more this is stupid, pay for your own ac or get a damn fan. i swear nyc focuses on the most minute things and ignores the blatant issues. very great idea. i hope it passes. would love for them to make them heat pump designed for the environment’s sake. there is nothing stopping people from buying and installing an air conditioner.  why do we need more pointless mandates? eh, i have 2 units in my apartment that work just fine. i’d rather see the city do something a bit more productive.  guys, this will raise your rents!!! don’t downvote me just because i don’t want to pay an extra increase for something i don’t even need. if you think it won’t, i have some oceanfront property in nebraska you might be interested in. oh hey look another rule and regulation! this is very short sighted. the use of ac is a major cause of global warming and the increasing number of heat-related deaths. there are plenty of sustainable building practices that can be used instead to reduce the need for ac. who is gonna pay the electric bill? if one has no $ they won’t use the ac even if one is provided. i probably value ac in my apartment more than i value the fridge or the stove. so not a bad idea for once. yeah and people wonder why rent is so high? honestly this is good. people are complaining about cost but acs are really not that costly. it would just require apartments to have them on move in rather than people buying them and installing them poorly. dealing with an apocalyptic global warming crisis… mandate more power sapping appliances? lincoln is a genius, as per usual. what is his plan to fund this to pay for the ac’s and the electric costs? i’m okay with the ac requirement but not okay with the temperature requirement  having to keep a unit at or under 78 at all times when the outdoor temperature is 82 or higher is insane. what if no one is home at the time? this is climate arson that’s cool and all. when are they doing something to actually bring rents down? rents will go up if they require ac this is both a great idea and terrible idea all at once. great because without ac, it's becoming unbearable and dangerous obviously: terrible because the costs are just going to be recovered via higher rents, as if.they weren't too high already. and such is the state of real estate, as i've come learn in the short 5 years i've been in the biz....everything is a double edged sword. about damn time. coming from nevada, it is crazy that ac isn’t mandatory. during the summer it’s a bare fucking necessity. this is both a good and bad idea.  bad idea because rents will go up.  good idea because a/cs are so expensive and so is the cost to repair them, so having that would be nice. what they don’t want to tell you is they going to raise your rent if this happens . they don’t want to tell you that. but google it yourself and also watch the news. people are fighting this why not waste money on stupid sidewalk repairs that are perfect but need a new ramp pad only(bc the color is not ada compliant) and spend it on ac units for high risk areas/people. the city is run so poorly. nyc politicians suck balls !! if they could afford jordan’s or a iphone, i’m sure they they could get a decent ac themselves there’s a housing crisis. nyc should get rid of all old tenement buildings built before 1950 and rebuild them with more density that would allow the tenants to come back with extra units for new tenants and include central air like the rest of the country.",419,154,neutral,0.4403381943702698,573,i think this is a good idea. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i think it passes. i hope it passes. i hope it passes. i hope it passes. i hope it
27,NYC Housing Connect: Are They Serious? How Is Area Median Income 130% = $3000 Rent,"this thread has run its course. a lot of conspiracy theories and a general lack of understanding about the vetting and qualifying process and even how taxes work. yeah i never understand that either. i think this really only helps people who don’t make a lot themselves but have rich parents who help them with rent. these prices make no sense for people who are supporting themselves. i used to look at the listings all the time but i can’t qualify. smh it's doable at that salary, but it's bonkers.  i've lived in mcol cities and was able to afford nice apartments in walkable, fun neighborhoods for less than 30% of my takehome pay.  the nyc metro (and other hcol areas) force average earners to pay 40%+ of their takehome pay, which makes it really difficult to save for the future or to be able to live in a way where you aren't constantly revisiting your budget. i feel you. i work as a school teacher and i do not make enough money for a lot of the """"affordable"""" housing units (studios included) on nychc. housing connect assumes you spend about 1/40th of gross income on rent. that's what most renters spend. so if you're in the 100-130k bracket that's the cost. what's dumb is that developers can get affordable housing tax benefits for $3,000 apartments you are preaching to the choir , it is truly crazy. sadly i dont see anything happening to change or better the situation. i kinda feel that the building owners and real estate people love the fact that there is an apartment shortage so they can squeeze more money out of the next person. affordable to me would 1 week of your paycheck to your rent or at least 1 week and a half. not your entire months salary. the ami includes wealthy suburbs like westchester and long island. they drive up housing prices. they also opposing all new construction, especially along transit lines, making the city extremely unaffordable.   so the surrounding suburbs are making the city unaffordable. ""afforable"" just means 30% of your pre-tax income. thats what makes it ""afforable"" that it is 30%. i agree in bonkers. rent in nyc is so out of control at the moment it’s actually disgusting. we need to build more affordable housing now and do it quickly. there’s so much unused and underdeveloped space all around the city, especially in south brooklyn. but thanks to our silly zoning laws we can’t do anything with it. the formula for ami is based off of the nyc counties + the surrounding suburban counties. they include:   	•	bronx (bronx county) 	•	brooklyn (kings county) 	•	manhattan (new york county) 	•	queens (queens county) 	•	staten island (richmond county) 	•	westchester county 	•	nassau county 	•	suffolk county 	•	putnam county 	•	rockland county 	•	orange county  it is determined by the dept of housing and urban development from the federal govt. nyc and nys don’t have any part of the math. if your salary is between 100-130k, then the rent is affordable, as it would be about 30% of your income. the question should be why is 30% of one’s income the benchmark. lots of misinformation in the comments here.  i've lived in a lottery apartment for several years now. i moved into a 1br for $2091 vs. paying $2200 for a top-floor walkup 1br a few blocks away.       i lived on my own and stretched myself a bit at the time, but i was able to upgrade to a luxury doorman/elevator building with amenities while saving a small amount of money in the short term, and a ton of money in the long term. my income is 38% higher than it was when i moved in, but my rent has only increased by 10% in the same period.   if you want to live in nyc for a year or two just to say you did it, landing a lottery apartment doesn't make much sense. it'll probably take at least a year before the income verification process begins, if you even get selected in the first place. finding a *home* and staying there is where it'll really, really pay off.  also, someone mentioned that you'd get to enjoy rent stabilization for ""15-35 years depending upon the tax abatement"", which is untrue. if you move into a housing lottery apartment, you'll be rent stabilized for as long as you live there, whether it's 5 years or 95 years. the tax abatement lasts for 15-35 years, but the rent stabilization is indefinite unless a tenant leaves and the abatement period has ended. *then* the landlord can charge market rate. just up front, my response is not a justification or anything -- more just relaying what the nyc housing connect defines as ""affordable housing"".  if you go to their [webpage](https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/publicweb/about-us), the nychc defines ""affordable housing"" as the following:  > housing is considered affordable if it costs about one-third or less of what the people living there get in income.  based on the webpage it isn't clear if they're calculating this with gross or net income, but the only way this makes sense is if they're calculating with gross income. then we have the following:  - 100k / 12 * 0.33 = 2778/mo - 130k / 12 * 0.33 = 3611/mo  now given taxes, your actual take-home pay would be:  - 100k: 5802/mo -> 33% = $1934/mo - 130k: 7279/mo -> 33% = $2426/mo is anybody else here in an annoying in-between income bracket that leaves you ineligible for most lotteries? i make around 90k which is always either too much for the ~80% ami lotteries that are around 2k for a studio or 1bd (which is really the max i can afford) but all the 130% ami apt require 6-figure incomes and are like 3k for single person units. ugh.  i almost accepted a 2.3k lottery studio a few months ago that i think was for 100% ami, but i was choosing between that and a 2k 1bd with an office in a rent stabilized building. kind of a no brainer to pick the bigger one (for me anyway). still would love to win a lottery one day tho. it's expensive for you now, but probably won't be in 1-3 years due to inflation + salary increases (hopefully). that's kind of the point. in less than 10 years that rent will be amazingly cheap. [deleted] how much are older same size apartments  in the same area? the answer is super simple, the city wants new development any way they can get it, they make deals with developers to build apt buildings with tax breaks under the smoke and mirrors campaign of whatever percent will be affordable. they make sure those posted rents cannot be paid by low/ middle income people, so they don’t bother to apply, which is what they want anyway, because they don’t want no broke asses living in their lux building period. they’d rather the apts allocated for affordability stayed empty. [deleted] i’m starting to see these “affordable” units popping up on zillow and streeteasy. they list them as income restricted so i think they’re supposed to be the rent stabilized units.   ex: i got selected for a building a while ago and they said there were no more units available, so the building was moved into the closed section of my portal. now that same building is listing rent stabilized units online!   anyone know how this is legal/possible? don’t they have to go back through the lottery numbers if previous winners move out? i totally agree 100%  i can only give my personal experience here   as a single person making around 120k , no kids etc i never qualify for these apartments, even the more expensive ones. i assume priority is given to families, single parents, city workersetc which makes sense but damn they don't leave anything for us and if they do they are ridiculously expensive, you basically have to make very little money and have family to qualify for these i get that people find this frustrating (no one wants to see a word ""affordable"" and have it be out of their price range) but it's still housing supply.   whatever you think about the ""type of people"" who this is affordable for -- when they move into one of these buildings it means they're not competing with you for the existing housing supply. this *does* lower rent on aggregate. are you really ranting about 40x rent? yeah it’s not great but it’s pretty much the norm. people would kill for that to be market rate. it’s much cheaper than market rate, which makes it more affordable.    you don’t have to live in a brand new built in 2024 rental building in the most expensive city in the world, you can go find a $2300 pre war 1br in brighton beach and just take yourself out of the race   so if the $3000 waiting list is 10,000 deep. the $2,000 waiting list would be 100,000 deep, the $1,000 waiting list would be 1,000,000 deep. how does this help you at all right? it doesn’t make sense that we’re “too poor” to apply for affordable housing. 🧐🤔🤨 $3,000 a month rent on a $130,000 salary still feels irresponsible to me. i spend less than that on my mortgage/fees/taxes and i make more than $130k now - and still feel like i’m just comfortable keeping up with savings + cost of living. is this based on household income or individual? at least they’ll list you- at 70% ami i might as well go fuck myself what i don't understand is how they have uiteds available for 80% ami which i'm over qualified for, but then the next bracket up is for 130% ami which i'm way underqualified for. what about those who are 100% ami??  or the ranges are ridiculous. they expect someone making $50k to pay the same rent $ as someone making $76k??! it's been pretty bad for awhile. if you're not dirt poor the rent they deem as ""affordable"" is usually still unreasonable. affordable appears to mean spending 60% of your income on rent. do you use your adjusted gross income or gross income? it seems plenty unfair to tax the living shit out of us and then count that money as if it’s available to spend here and now. the problem is that these units are exorbitantly priced and are munchkin sized! i don't care that there's a rooftop garden or a billiards or computer room! i don't want to leave my cell to go sit in the party room or whatever they call it! i'd like a tiny bit of dignity and a place to dream and it's impossible to do that in a 150 sf hallway/kitchen/living room! and i would have the joy of paying $3000 mo rent? these apartments aren't for the people making $75,000 yr, and once the trust funders move out of their apartments into a lottery building, landlords keep or increase the rent, so it does nothing to help working class folks! nyc housing connect is a gaffle and they want your venmo / cashapp transactions.   i'm good.  i'll settle for the 5000x the rent and 999 credit score landlords want because my cashapp is on fire. if it’s for a 3bdrm apartment, that’s a great deal. you are free to pay market rate and fork $4.5-5k if this system upsets you.   you are also stating a 70% tax rate.  i think those numbers are workable with. are you saving a lot?

28,STAY AWAY FROM JUNE HOMES,"sounds it’s poorly run and predatory .  good on you to stand your ground.  i would avoid companies like a plague report to department of consumer and worker protection please wow. i'm just shocked agree 100%. i did a 1 month rental with june homes when i first moved to the city before i found a more permanent spot and the whole process was marred by bad communication, hidden fees, being overcharged, and a gross apartment.   june homes is awful. thank you for this i was on the fence with june homes. wait until you hear about july homes… good to know. i subleased when i first moved here and luckily found two back to back private subleases via fb. june homes definitely popped up but i blocked them because i was at work, sent their sales rep’s calls to voicemail, and then he tries calling two or three more times…  i sent a text saying “hey, if i send you to voicemail i’m clearly busy. please stop calling repeatedly. i am not interested in june homes”   have only heard from them once since. i nearly died of carbon monoxide in one of their apartments and they almost didn’t let me cancel my lease and refund my security deposit good to know. i blocked their emails because they kept spamming me and trying to contact me it’s august, of course i would. had a similar experience with outpost club. please file a complaint with the ag, they are the only one these companies fear.

[deleted] thank you for this in depth post! i  knew it sounded too good to be true! i appreciate your time and restraint in this post. did you inspect the apartment before moving in? if so, why did you accept it in a filthy and run down condition. these companies keep doing this because people let them. they don’t care after the fact because they already got your money.",395,55,negative,0.7342767715454102,450,"june homes. i had a call with them for a room and got really bad vibes. i really questioned them hard and got out all the hidden bullshit fees they would’ve implemented. i had a room listed for $1,200 in a syracuse apartment complex and was charged $1,200 for it. i was charged $1,200 for it. i was charged $1,500 for it."
29,11-story building is losing elevator access,"this happend to my friend. i can't remember if he lived on the 9th or 11th floor of a 20 story building. the work was suppose to be for 2 months then went on for 4 then 6 months. he ended up moving in with his girlfriend. oof. what if you were disabled?? withholding rent for required maintenance or modernization issue is not going to go well for you. you're going to be fit as hell after this lol the solutions are to negotiate a lease break or a private rent reduction. withholding rent unilaterally is not going to help the situation. practically, your landlord can still sue you and you would litigate the issue in court, with the threat of an eviction or money judgment over your head. you would have also burned the bridge with your landlord.   by the same token, if you broke the lease and your landlord tried to sue you for the few thousand left over, you would have a defense to repayment whose cost of litigating would eat up any meaningful reward.   this puts the parties in the position to negotiate to actually get what they want: either permission to break the lease and move, or a reasonable rent concession. jesus. that’s brutal. how many months on your lease? i’d seek legal advice on what breaking your lease might look like. there may be language in your lease that states the ll is required to give you access to an elevator, with a “cure period” if they can’t perform. if that language is present, i doubt the cure period would extend for months.   my take is that your ll knows how brutal this is, and wouldn’t be surprised if several tenants just parted with their security deposit and fled the building.  also, 2 months screams full elevator replacement to me. anything less would be unacceptable. a partial modernization could take only a few days. my guess is 2 months is a conservative estimate, and this may only be 1-1.5 months. ![gif](giphy|jhmxzw3xyadge)  legs gonna be ripped my guy how is there one elevator for an 11 story building? no freight? this happened to a friend of mine when sandy hit. lived on high floor, building was out of electricity for more than a week, brutal. threaten to move out. nobody is going to rent a 10th floor walk up apartment. they should be reasonable & reduce your rent. elevator is probably due for a mod. boards going bad, parts maybe not available anymore. not sure of its shutdown history, but maybe it's running on some old components and it's time to modernize due to frequent shut downs. but 11 stories is kinda high for a 1 car job. under engineered imo.  -elevator mechanic i would talk to a lawyer. maybe go to one of the pro-bono sessions for housing. contact your local city council person.  there’s a law about buildings over 6 floors needing elevators.  i can understand emergencies but two months?!  something seems sketchy.  it is unrealistic of management to expect folks to just accept it. ah, like when they shut the gas off in my sisters building for a week, said it would be a week or two, but ended up being months.  they had to get a special gas truck for the building because it actually voided everyone’s requirement to pay rent. i feel really sorry for you but i don’t have any advice. i just signed for an apartment on the top (5th) floor and they made me sign a document along with my lease saying that elevators are a luxury and if they are down for extended periods there is nothing we can do about it. hopefully you didn’t sign anything like that my apt in ues is also about to start it. maybe we live in same building. elevator was not working properly at least once a week so it’s true they need to fix it but it’ll be difficult for high floor peeps if the elevator needs to be fixed it needs to be fixed. nothing really can do - understand it sucks but things have to be modernized or repaired at some point. as others have said i’d break your lease or obtain some sort of concessions cancel your gym membership and start taking stairs. new fear unlocked.  i’m really sorry op. this sucks :( the mayor has gutted tenants rights and housing court is just for show now. be careful and be nice and maybe they agree to concessions. it sucks good news is you can skip leg days at the gym now. hell you don't even need to bring your legs to the gym now. that’s insanely messed up; do not try to withhold rent without going to court, but do take it up with management/speak to a lawyer/ see if you can relocate during that time, etc no one likes leg day dob building code during construction states that an elevator must be in readiness for fdny at all times when a building reaches over 75’. i can’t see that changing for when a building is occupied. i’d look into building code but i wouldn’t know where to start. sounds rough . but if there’s only one elevator and maintenance is mandatory i guess there’s no option . i don’t think there’s much you can do outside of potentially filing complaints if you have a disability. i work in social services and countless people in wheelchairs, using walkers, etc have this happen to them and a complaint will be filed but nothing else happens by the city. maybe a small fine to the building and no increase in speed to getting the elevator back up and running. what’s your plan? are you going to move out? work it work it!!!! fuck the elliptical! best bet is lease break. recently, we've had to fix the elevator in the building where i work. it took a little over a month, because they had to purchase a part from overseas and it took forever for it to arrive. i don't know whether it was the shipping that was slow or if they had to produce the part from the factory.   it's a 3 story building (4 if you include the basement) and people were moaning about taking the stairs to the third floor.   so, i think it's not uncommon for elevator repairs to take so long. it's a nice gesture that your building is setting up a chair on a few floors with water. i know it's going to be a pain to carry groceries or packages upstairs. the same goes for them with carrying water upstairs. https://up.codes/s/elevator-in-readiness you’ll be lucky if it’s only out for 2 months i guarantee it’ll take a minimum 4-6 months my building in brooklyn had to replace their elevator like 5 years ago not fun luckily i was only on the 3rd floor my building gas was off for a year, not the heat but the gas for the stove.  a group got together to try and force rent reduction. it went nowhere.  other than giving us hotplates.   at best they might offer to let you out of your lease with no penalty. if that happens weigh your options if it is worth it for a 2 month inconvenience. wow! now i know if i ever move into an elevator bldg make sure there are 2-4 elevators! or i'm no higher than 5th floor lol i’d be moving out and just informing them i’m out. good luck filling that apartment lol suck it up and walk until it’s fixed it’s a federal offense. contact them. they can repair/replace in a day. i lived on the 9th floor of a building during a 4 month elevator replacement. i don’t recall the amount but i do know we were given a rent decrease for the time period. the higher the floor you were, the bigger the decrease.  we were also given the option break the lease without penalty. it was a rough few months but my legs and butt we’re in killer shape at the end of it. similar thing happened to my building, pregnant neighbor just withheld rent i'm a lawyer but i'm not your lawyer. don't withhold rent, your landlord can sue you for nonpayment if you do. first you can try negotiating a rent reduction with your landlord until elevator service is restored. if that goes nowhere, call 311 and ask for the tenant helpline. sometimes they can provide quick advice over the phone. there may be a legal services organization that 311 can refer you to who you can also give you quick advice. if that also goes nowhere, you can file suit in housing court against your landlord. housing court is designed largely for pro se parties -- people with no representation -- so usually there is a fairly straightforward checkbox form to fill out if your landlord has breached your lease agreement or a city or state law. just look at it as an exercise program.  good opportunity to build up your quads. you're getting a free exercise plan. if you are young and fit you will probably be ok but it won’t be fun. unless you have a young child or are disabled it’d not a big deal complaining won’t make them work faster as it had to be safe while work is done and when it’s in service. just be glad not going on in the summer then it’s hot and everyone’s sweaty from the flights up and stinking  up the stairwell",392,104,negative,0.6934521794319153,496,. have a gym membership now. can skip leg days at the gym now. can skip leg days at the gym now. i’m sorry op. this sucks. the mayor has gutted tenants rights and housing court is just a show now. be careful and be nice and maybe they agree to concessions. good news is you can skip leg days at the gym now. hell you can skip leg days at the gym now.
30,I see everyone who’s able to afford like 3-5k Apt on there own… and just wondering what do you do for work.. and are they hiring ? 😅,"personal finance in new york is wild. i have friends who make a lot of money and can technically afford to live in apartments that are expensive, but probably shouldn’t. my friend who probably makes the most money (and has a rare two story apartment) also has significant credit card debt they don’t have plans to pay off fully and no real retirement savings. i’m convinced that most of the city is pretty bad at money in favor of keeping up with the joneses. i can afford $5k as a software engineer  but i will never nyc is a hub for finance jobs (investment banking, private equity) and tech jobs at the big companies (meta and google in particular have large nyc presence).   hence why there's so many people with large budgets. yo forreal there’s a wide range between affording $3k and affording $5k; per standard reqs, that equates to respective salaries of $120k and $200k   i can “afford” $4k, technically speaking, but i actually pay $2k  i do accounting, and i bartend; dollar-for-dollar, i earn about the same per hour at both jobs  yes, we are hiring accountants; no, we are not hiring bartenders work in marketing/ad tech. i can technically afford 4k in rent but choose not to, currently paying 1750 in a rent-stabilized studio. could contemplate up to maybe 2.5-3k to upgrade to a nicer 1 bedroom but that's a big maybe and would have to depend on the apartment! software engineer, big tech. i could afford 5.5k a month based on the 40x rule but that seems outrageous so capped myself at 3.5k  edit: comments locked so can’t reply but i had 1 yoe when i got my current job. i did however do 5 internships before my last job. attorney and i can barely cover my rent though it’s possible. software the people that i know who afford such apartments went to top universities, had almost perfect gpas, got the right internships, and now work for big tech companies or hedge funds, private equity, investment banking. or have rich parents.   unfortunately it’s pretty rare to be able to afford such a place outside those circumstances. tech sales. they are always hiring but you start at the bottom (well worth the easy life) if it's not a tech worker couple, a tech worker from an ivy school, or an institutionalized tech worker, then it's a lawyer, doctor, or finance slave family money and/or international money not worth   you get a better return investing those funds into smart stocks i work in marketing everyone i know who lives in that price range has minimum 2 roommates tech, finance, law, medicine, lots of career paths to $200k+. not a secret, you do well in school and you put in the work.

31,WTF happened to the $3k/month luxury studio,"i’m still seeing a few in lic on streeteasy i just won an “affordable” housing lottery for a new build luxury studio in midtown and the market rate is more than $4k+. i was shocked at how small it was and how many people in the building paid market rate for that. i even felt that the lottery rate of $2.4k was too much. they put up two walls and call it a 2br and they’re $4500 a month it exists north of 125th st and in the bronx. long island city (lic), queens… you might get studios around 3.5k .. they are definitely on the smaller side but buildings are good and so is the area jersey city r/circlejerknyc corporate landlords something like this (although slightly over)? https://streeteasy.com/rental/4433211? i’ve seen several studios in doorman buildings for $33-3500 around murray hill.   and since you mention rooms, yes there are rooms in a 2 bed around ~$6k total if you’re looking to spend $3k yourself and share an apartment. what considers luxury? mostly long gone the good ol days! 😔 [deleted] idk… i feel like $3k and luxury building don’t go together. if you are pushing your budget just to be in a luxury building, just keep in mind they increase the rent substantially every year. i found a luxury one-bedroom in a good area for $3.3k. some of the units are warehoused. try asking agents and building employees about which units haven’t been listed yet. bronx is probably not your ideal choice but there are about 10 new high rises along 149 street and 138th street station on the 4 and 5 train.  there is a bike path along the river. people will laugh you out of the thread but a buddy of mine lives in a really nice legit 1br apartment in astoria. high rise, amenities everything. think he pays $2500/mo. his direct area is a tiny bit dicey but he’s a 15 min walk from dt astoria which is a great area. he lives right by the ferry. i’d consider it. i might actually look for lease breaks, and see if you can take over a stabilized lease. i also would suggest looking for a condo or coop rental in a building that has elevator laundry and maybe pt door.   best of luck,  suzanne look at new construction—- typically they need to hurry yp and lease and will give a couple months free rent… so in reality you save if you sign a yr or two lease the rent is so high now that everyone is just accepting it, thinking it will go higher in the future. i rent a studio in fort greene for $2450 where are you looking, street easy for only white neighborhoods with the most possible filters? girlllll. ask around or look on craigslist like a savvy new yorker jc ugh, manhattan. i've seen a couple in fort greene and downtown brooklyn.  look up buildings 257 gold street and 81 dekalb avenue in brooklyn check out a newest rental at 2840 atlantic ave brooklyn. they have studio starting at $3050 but it comes with 3 month free and some other move in bonus. make your net effective rent to low $2k. you’re gonna have to turn away from the luxury buildings. hate to break it to you, but for the amenities you’re maybe looking for you’re just not gonna find any “luxury” studio under $3,000. that expectation is unrealistic. now, you can find many studios under $3,000 in non-luxury buildings across manhattan. my partner and i just signed a lease in northern hk for around $2,600 for an alcove studio. ours is in an old tenement building just as most of the apartments in hk are. so if you’re willing to forgo the “luxury” moniker for a studio you’ll be able to find plenty within your budget. are the realpage antitrust lawsuits still ongoing? most corporate landlords in this country use them and they fix rents based on the software’s algorithm. op, speak to actual brokers at established agencies with large inventories like corcoran or the building management companies. just because no units are currently available for rent doesn't mean they aren't aware of future vacancies that you could take advantage of. there are also sometimes unlisted units for whatever reason. obviously be prepared to pay the broker's fee if you go through the former route, luxury studio. an oxymoron. get over the idea of newness = luxury and you can rent a massive 1 bedroom. you’ll never actually use that pool table in the “community rec room” anyway. yo - check out downtown brooklyn, south slope.   that’s where i live and got a nice new spot for 3.7k in a 1 br. new building. solid amenities. next to train. you can go to the south bronx probably you are not out of your mind, but corporations and the whole american economic system is out of their minds. there are people who would be willing to pay $3k/month for a studio? i’m sorry but why? i’ve seen a few in plg/flatbush this literally feels like some agent conspiracy post to get people more comfortable with higher rents through over exposure lmfao.   i live in a nice 1 bedroom (not studio) in bk with central air, dishwasher, the works. $2500 per month.  stop trying to claim that no nice nyc apartments exist under 3k there are 400sqft luxury studios going for 3k in lic, good area and a lot of amenities. yeah idk if i’ve seen anything remotely “luxury” for less than $4k these days. maybe $3500 but i doubt it. i pay 4k to live in a nice studio on the upper west side… i wanted to find a cheaper place to live in an amenities building (studio still) and there is hardly anything it’s insane when are you looking to move? i’m currently renting a studio spot in chelsea paying $2400 (doorman building, full amenities) m2m. fee free to dm me if you are interested. if it’s under 3500 then it will be over that soon enough the axel in clinton hill my observations show that if you move may-august rents are higher than any other time throughout the year.  having said that, i keep an eye on buildings from one particular management company, and they currently have a great studio for under $3k in their full service tower in rego park should you decide to look into it. (rose associates, the alexander) i also like to check streeteasy for past rents in the buildings i’m interested in, and rent in that that particular one hasn’t been increasing as much as in many others.   a colleague is renting at 4545 center blvd in lic, he’s at $3500/month and got a 1-month concession. insanity is right.  my adult kid is trying to move to her own place (currently in share w 2 roommates).  their share rent is 1k.  to get out they have to now spend 3.5k--crazy! dude, even newark has luxury studios nowadays starting at 2k . unless we keep building all across the area prices won’t cool down try the north edge of greenpoint:   [https://streeteasy.com/complex/tower-77](https://streeteasy.com/complex/tower-77)  [https://streeteasy.com/building/the-bellslip](https://streeteasy.com/building/the-bellslip)  [https://streeteasy.com/building/72-box-street-brooklyn#rentals](https://streeteasy.com/building/72-box-street-brooklyn#rentals)  or very south williamsburg   [https://streeteasy.com/complex/420-kent-avenue](https://streeteasy.com/complex/420-kent-avenue)  or you can get lucky near downtown brooklyn (winner winner chicken dinner with this one)  [https://streeteasy.com/building/boulevard-east/4k?from\_map=1](https://streeteasy.com/building/boulevard-east/4k?from_map=1) lic/harlem or take a time machine back to 2010 seems like in manhattan there are a few at$4500 at the low end so no one making under $200000 is getting them anymore it seems. you can get a way better price than that right next to a path station in new jersey. yes! but they’re not listed on streeteasy or zillow. move to downtown stamford/harbor point area. close to the train. a 50 minute commute to grand central. beautiful luxury apartments with pools and tons of amenities there is a luxury building in ridgewood called ridgewood theater building.  you can get 1 br for that price i haven't seen anything that cheap in 10 years. i just snagged a teeny tiny one in plg for $2,500 (+ 15% broker fee) - after weeks and weeks of dragging myself to truly depressing units that were still knee-deep with competition.   my working theory is that new-ish buildings where management still have regular interaction with city agencies are incentivized to play by the rules to a greater extent than most. vacancies don't pop up often, but if you're quick on the draw you have a fighting chance. fidi ocean hill/bed stuy checks this box depending on what you mean by luxury. don’t take it personally op but i really don’t understand people who wants to live in luxury buildings but acting cheap…how can we expect a luxury building with full amenities in summer 2024 having lower rates than the one you mentioned……if you can’t afford just live like 99% of the remaining of the world. an elevator building should do the job for your price range and yes there’s a life and plenty of very decent apartments uptown manhattan. they brought them to la! puddle of water in the lobby and an elevator that rarely works!! its luxurious!!! have to look in outer boroughs, little further out from the city looking to assign my $3250 rent-stabilized studio in midtown op. sent you a dm! if anyone else is interested feel free to reach out. amenities include gym, office suite, rooftop, laundry room, weekly towels and bed linens change there’s a few in fidi. i just signed a lease for a studio in a “luxury building” for 3k yesterday, no fees. just gotta be quick and place your holding deposit as soon as you can. i am trying to find someone to take over my lease! studio in manhattan in a high rise in herald square if anyone is interested yes this shit is nuts. i’m considering taking a sabbatical to work at whole foods or something to be eligible for lotteries. i’m in a $3200 two-bedroom in queens but it’s definitely not luxury 3k for a studio is insane. i pay less for a 2 bed lol in fact i’d never live in a studio, it’s just way too much compromise. don’t need my bed across my stove. would much rather live 20 mins further to have a 1 bed. 1 bed is the absolute minimum if you're willing to live in an ""up and coming"" area of clinton hill/crown heights, i bet you could find something you like in that range.   seems to me that studios are in the $3s, 1bdrms in the mid $4s, and 2 bdrms about $6000 just about anywhere trendy right now (but a brooklyn room is still bigger than a manhattan room). this is the peak of the market 3k for a luxury studio is totally doable - in february, try to negotiate extending your lease to the low season $3k for luxury your dreaming if you're remote, move as far away from the city as you can. no reason to stay, family, friends, are all overrated.  it's all about money. friends and family will follow if you have money.  sick world. looks the the 3k-sub 3k is now in  southern brooklyn. luxury building?

it’s a walk up so nothing fancy but i feel super lucky for the location and how much space i still have i hope you’ll include, that, despite ‘lower’ rents during the height of covid and a seemingly kinder nyc, rents, even in what were recently considered less ‘desirable’ areas, have largely rocketed. there is a predatory feeling to how it all is everywhere. also, realtors ask for so much more information from potential tenants now which feels super invasive when, for years, somehow, credit check, letter of reference, and proof of income sufficed. and who determined 40x amount of rent in income is necessary?   the point commenter here made about 50 thousand apartments being kept vacant by landlords should be its own article. with limited supply, landlords are able to jack rents up. if only you could interview 2016 me.   here in 2024? fuhgeddaboutit. 850 in middle village i pay $820 for a small room in a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment in bed-stuy. i pay 950 with two roommates in ridgewood! just moved into this apartment last year. my room is small but fine, has a window. i even work from home in it. i pay 1500 and have 2 roommates and share a bathroom i am crying at these replies sorry if this (at least partially) off-topic. read until the end to see how it relates.   moved into a great studio (kitchen, full bathroom, decent condition) on greenwich avenue between 10th and 11th streets in the fall of 1975. the rent was — wait for it — $170 a month. same apartment today rents for about $2,500, and imho is worth it. great block, great neighborhood, etc. more significant is the feeling you have every time you walk out the door into a bustling, diverse, safe, and vibrant community. every freaking time. and being ten or fifteen minutes away from work is a perk that can’t be overestimated. if you’re looking for a place, start close to where you’re working.  stayed for almost twenty-five years. when i left, the rent was about $600, thanks to rent stabilization. had i stayed, i’d be up around $1,000 a month. that’s where you’ll probably find the largest cohort (at least in the more desirable areas) of low rents — people who’ve been living in the same rent-stabilized apartment for decades.  and a final note. almost didn’t take that apartment because the rent was $20 over my ""maximum"". doing so was one of the best and most important decisions i ever made. yes, rents are ridiculously expensive. and worth it. my son is finishing college and will be looking for a place this spring. i told him if he finds a place in my old building, i’ll pay half. people stop. don’t tell them anything. $1000 with 1 roommate in a 2br in prime ridgewood 550$, sunset park-brooklyn. i have a modest size 2 bedroom apartment $1059 my housemate/landlord is rent-stabilized at $2000 give or take some change in the uws so i pay $1000 for a large room in a nice building. it's a horrifying place to live because she has the reputation of being the neighborhood demon and is a terrible person, but i ignore her drama and it's workable. i've been here for two years and i am trying to find/create a stabilized place full of sane people closer to my age.  i don't want you guys to do a story on this. i want you to do a story on what it will take to get universal rent stabilization, or vastly more stabilized housing in this city, and the people trying to make it happen. i rent a storage space in hollywood florida for $265 a month lol sent a pm i’m happy to chat with you 🙂 i pay 1043 for my studio apartment in bushwick if split with my wife it's $890 in astoria for a 1br. i pay just about 1000 including all carrying costs and utilities for a one bedroom, upper manhattan. my landlord confused me with the other white lady who lives in my building and i accidentally found out she is paying $630 for her one bedroom apartment. i pay $1700, which is still a good deal for the neighborhood (chinatown). i do wonder if my apartment is supposed to be rent stabilized though. i haven’t been able to find any conclusive information online. 850 in bushwick! it’s going to be section 8 i just won the housing lottery! i pay a little over a thousand for a studio. i’m in the fort green/clinton hill area. my family owns the building and i pay >1000 also have 2 roommates i was sharing a 5 bedroom “apartment” and paying $830 a month. i didn’t last 8 months. currently back in my parent’s attic. this better be a story about people who pay rent without a roommate apartments not rooms i pay $1500 for a 1br (not a studio) in harlem. yeah, it's not under $1000, but it sure feels affordable relative to all the horror stories i see about rent here. my rent for a large rent stabilized junior 4 in riverdale is $2173 a month. i pay $900, my partner pays the rest. we have a newly renovated kitchen with dishwasher, balcony, laundry in building, and garage parking for an extra fee. it wasn’t listed, but we connected with a realtor who knew it had just become available. happy to talk more! a coworkers who makes about 200k a year was looking at 3k a month apartments. i told him to wait. long story short he did and got a rent stabilized with 100k net worth requirement at 900 a month on the ues right before he got laid off (7 months ago and still unemployed). one bed top floor on four floor walk up. butter up the realtor, he found him a car. as someone who has been in the business a long time, realtors save the good stuff for people they like unless they need the money. we just adopted a “territorial” cat from the acc. he is paying $0 rent for the illegal  basement apartment that comes with every other house in nyc.  so, i guess be a frequent flyer to nyc’s kitty prison system and you can get a free apartment too. it seems he gets upset if he sees outdoor cats so at least the windows are way too high. i know it’s a basement apartment but it has its own washer & dryer and a cool 1958 pink overnight and all that exposed brick makes for a great scratching post. 🤣  https://preview.redd.it/dcso9d9njsec1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ec9e198393d045457de16534d67b095205e3e44 when i moved here a decade ago my rent was $1k. i lived on canal st in a 7bed 2br flat. had 0 windows or closet in my bedroom. turns out that apt wasn’t exactly “legit” and has since been shut down. i feel like you can easily pay under 1k with roommates. i’d be interested to know who is living alone with 1k or under. own a mitchell lama co op in inwood, $1200 3 bedrooms and all utilities included (internet, cable, gas, electricity) great building, safe and clean; 4 maintenance people.  i wouldn’t be able to do it if it wasn’t for the mitchell lama protection i still pay well under market value in greenpoint on mccarren park. been living here for 15 years, should be paying double what our first floor 2 bedroom costs now. our landlord is a gem. 1000 for a two bedroom in ridgewood. no sharing just me. not the best parking but you have easy access to everything like trains, busses, food, and i think they’re opening a target like a block away. i overheard someone who was apparently a super somewhere around east midtown telling a store clerk that his building just rented two studios at $2050/mo.   lord, i see what you have done for others and want it for myself. $1,000, studio, rent stabilized i pay $850 for my one bedroom in east harlem. rent stabilized. i pay $2800 for a 670 sq foot “one bedroom” (aka large studio with french doors shoved in the middle) in greenwich village, a block from washington square park. i moved in right before the pandemic and am still here, but recently found out the tenet in the same unit above me is paying $950 because they’re subletting it from someone whose rent is controlled. i’m pretty sure subletting in the building is illegal and i understand in the overall scheme of things my rent is not insane for a “one bedroom” in this area but i still can’t shake it off.   what’s even more confusing to me is that i had looked at the rent controlled unit above me when i first moved in a few years back and it was not presented to me in that way, but instead listed a monthly rent on par with what i pay for mine now. what is going on here?  it honestly makes me feel so bad inside. there’s probably a ton of laws and rules regarding rent control that i’m unaware of, but it all feels scummy and i keep wondering whether or not my landlord even is aware of what’s going on. just so shady. i pay less than my partner for a 1br with a total rent of 2300 in two bridges with a (quite) small but updated apartment, sub zero fridge, and luxury stove. our rent was supposed to increase but never did. i’m pretty sure we’re supposed to be rent stabilized after looking into our landlord and apartment. i’ve reached out to a lawyer recently since we’re currently lease to lease dispite reaching out to landlord. our unit is currently listed (as rented) on streeteasy for 4k. new york times is going to talk to 8-10 people and write a piece of shit article on how there are still affordable apartments in nyc. i pay $2,000 for a one bedroom on the upper east side. been there for about 2 years now. 1800 for a very small 1bed in murray hill manhattan in 2009 i was paying $600 for a small tiny room in south bronx. 1k is unheard of. less than two grand for a three bedroom. could easily be paying under a thousand but would rather have the extra space than the extra money. i used to pay 700 a month in greenpoint for a room. $0 swatting unknowingly in your mom’s attic but i share the room with a damn racoon /s free in rikers. food and utilities included i paid $800 for a room in manhattan. this was in midtown east and it was about two years ago! my old neighbor, who had been in the building her whole life, said “honey, my cigarettes cost more than my rent“. lol i cheapest i’ve paid for rent was 12 years ago in east village for $1300/mo 😅 [deleted] i got my apartment during covid. it’s $2k month for a 1 bedroom with a very large balcony and a private red brick patio/backyard. it’s located in the carnegie hill historic district. it’s rent stabilized. my wife and so are expecting our first in ajay and i dread the idea of releasing the apartment but we need more space. i mean, 4 years ago i was paying $950 a month on what was barely a 2 bedroom in bed stuy. but that’s bc i divided up the rent as i saw fit . if split equally i would have been a little over a grand. so not even. and that was a fucking hike to the subway. unless you’re talking multiple roommates in upper manhattan, outer queens or deep brooklyn, or bronx, no one pays under $1k in an apartment by themselves unless it’s mega rent control…. gtfo who is paying that anymore… 😂 if anyone has a good 2bed recommendation under $2500 please pm me! [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] back in 2017, i paid $915 for a room in a lovely 3 bedroom split between 4 people in greenpoint. loved it! back in 2017, i paid $915 for a room in a lovely 3 bedroom split between 4 people in greenpoint. loved it! $850 in brooklyn. but i have 3 roommates. i pay 679 for a 3 bedroom in park slope. i pay $900. three roommates in a 4/2 in bedstuy. same apt for 8 years. i keep a full time job and a good side hustle i pay $2000 below market in my neighborhood but the amount i pay it’s not going to make a headline live in brooklyn, i pay $850 with roommates 0 at home i used to pay $767 deep in bushwick, 3 of us split rent evenly. went up to $850 my 2nd year when we split rent by room size. (2019-2021) i no longer pay rent or live with several roommates 😃 $1430 studio in bay ridge i pay $713 in bushwick, got insanely lucky on a craigslist apartment with shitty roommates. you want to talk to some confidential informants too? how about someone who just snitched on their gang? my folks have an one bedroom apartment in les for $700. it’s a lottery apartment (i got one too but i pay more). my partner and i pay $900 a apiece for an apartment in south harlem. we both work for trader joe’s. my significant other lives in a basement studio in west new york (jersey), practically next to the bus stop so 30 min from midtown for $600, not sure if that counts. $838 in washington heights with 3 roommates. small room but big apartment i live alone in a 3 bedroom in bk for $1900 i have a friend who pays $700 in a three bed in sunset park my partner and i pay 650 each for a big-ass pre-war studio in astoria. it's rent-controlled and she has been there for 13 years. i’m about to be moving out of a bushwick studio. been paying 1300 for 7 years. i can’t believe i have to move. 1,000 or less ?

seriously? 😂 my son has a great deal. he gave up his apt in bk and moved back home to be able to afford an art studio. my girlfriend's parents pay 80% of our rent 1332 i know someone paying under $300 for a 1br.   the trick is moving in around 1979 and never leaving. i pay 800 for a room in greenpoint my wife and i have rented in brighton beach for $1600 which is 800 a person, but like... the actual unit was a 1 bed. prior flatbush place was a studio for 1600.   paying 800 for half of a one person living situation isnt a flex at all. you could get a full studio for that elsewhere to yourself. are y’all writing a comedy piece or something? lol $1000 or less is a great concept for that cheapest i ever got for a non shared place was like 10 years ago and it was $750 for a studio in the ne bronx.  i think in order to get sub $1000 you are talking roommates and or a private landlord, or possibly even an illegal dwelling. the people you want to interview don't use apps or barely know how to text. i know 2 older folks in the village with duplexes paying about 1k rent controlled. they maintained their own apartments and bought appliances. the owners are just counting their days. plenty of van lifers and car living folks around the 5 boroughs that pay 1/10th of that. i envy them greatly!! i have a roommate i compensate for and keep her under $1k because ive had horror roommates in the past and shes kind and gentle and i want her to stay lol. and i dont think she could afford anything else/anywhere else i’ve met a lot of people living in 1-2bd rms in ev for like $600-700 because it’s been handed down through their family since the 70s or 80s. hmm…i never paid that less, but a lot of my friends lived in like bay ridge and stuff, and had line 5/6 roommates and paid < 1000. but those apartments were not completely safe the idea that rent less than 1000$ exists here 🙃. we pay 3200 for a 1.5 bed in clinton hill (with a yard!!!) which is a steal compared to our neighbors and that's more than double my sister's mortgage. this article will be wild. i'm at 1600, that's the whole rent because i am grandfathered in, i live in uptown manhattan near the a train no way in hell will i be revealing how i got my cheap apartment or my cheap 2,000 sq ft house that i was in previously.  what you think we wanna do? screw up the rentals for ourselves? i no longer live there, but i lived in a gateway arms property on si, in st. george/near the ferry for $900 a few years ago; i understand the current rent for a 1br is still under $1,000. my roommate pays $1075 and we’re in a not shitty apartment in bushwick.   i used to pay $950 for the smallest room and no closet at a 3 bd/2b in east williamsburg i pay $1000 for my bedroom in bushwick off the halsey l, and my roommates pay ~800 each. happy to talk! i do and i’m interested! couple relevant stray thoughts:  * my partner and i have a ""great deal"" in an otherwise expensive neighborhood - $2,600/mo for 2 bedrooms in south slope/greenwood area, where rent for 2 bedrooms easily eclipses the $4k mark. though based on the linked thread, this might be as outlandishly good of a deal as you're looking for. either way, *those* deals probably just aren't happening in 2024 without some serious string-pulling. * my partner pays less than 1k and i pay the difference. this is a concession based on the difference in our incomes + the fact that i have already paid off my student loans but they haven't. * this was the quietest apartment we could afford (that allows dogs) following a horrific experience with a bar that opened underneath our last apartment. with that in mind, we were ready to make concessions on the space, but boy howdy have we made a lot of concessions. nobody in our building is remotely satisfied with our ll, and i would feel comfortable calling him a slumlord in that respect. fixes are done cheaply and sloppily, and he once came to yell at us once we reported the building to the city following a string of 8 or 9 mouse complaints that he did not directly address. so with that in mind, i put ""great deal"" in quotations marks, because we have had to make trade-offs. rent isn't the only price you do/can pay to live in the neighborhood. * our neighborhood is being aggressively gentrified. in the last year i believe at least 3 buildings on our block have been completely re-built and sold as condos. all of these were similar buildings to ours in that they were fairly unkempt and likely below-median in terms of rent. last year, the bank came to look at our units and confirm what we were being charged per month and everyone in the building was certain it was going to be sold to some developer or other, though that doesn't seem to have borne fruit so far. point is, it seems like a lot of these opportunities to trade away comfort for a looser budget seem to be going away - at least in our neighborhood where it's quiet, green, and close to things. $1000 pp including utilities for 5 of us sharing a 3 story brownstone in mott haven. has a backyard and washer dryer i pay $1100 including utilities for a tiny studio in bushwick. i have no oven though lol so most1,000$-less folks all live with roomates.. right? i sublet a room to a guy for 700. room is queen sized and has space for a desk and has a closet i pay less than $1000, i’ve actually never paid more than $1000 and this is my 3rd apartment since 2020. definitely live in/have lived in some unique places and always down to tell me story mine is $875 for a one bedroom in the bronx little? lol, years ago i came to this sub looking for spots in manhattan for $1,000 or under. everyone laughed and no advice was given. i now live in the uws paying $798 for my portion in a three bed, two bathroom apartment. found the place on craigslist $250 for a 2br in north williamsburg i pay zero dollars bought an rv and live 2 blocks away from the east river this was a few years ago but i was paying 400 cash to live in deep brooklyn with two other people in the same room lmao. it was a nightmare but cheap my girlfriend and i share a room in an apartment in bushwick w/ 2 other roommates. we pay $587.5 each (so $1175 for our room). that said though, it’s an apartment with a yard and we have an extra room in the basement we all share for storage / work / etc! so we essentially live as 4 people in a 4 bedroom (w/ one room as a shared space) i think i speak for most of us. only below 1k if it's co op, multiple roommates  small rooms $650 nassau county long island, heat, internet included, fully furnished brand new queen matress, dresser and armoire w mirror one closet. cons. 1.5 hour commute to the city for work, no stove only microwave and college sized fridge. i pay $287 every first for long ialand rail road but this is the best deal im gonna get trying to stay here for a while. i don’t pay anything $950. rent controlled, midtown, wifes aunt had it since the early 80s and passed it on to us. i can't speak for myself (almost 1.2), but have a friend that pays 600~ for a studio in central park, because of rent controlled building. i pay $850 for a room in a 3 bedroom in western queens in a nice neighborhood with no noticeable crime or disturbances. not a trendy area but not far from the city. my room it self is about 16x12 with 9’ ceilings. only downside is no living room in the apartment my mom pays 700 for her apartment. her rent was able to be frozen cuz of her age. ever heard of public housing? partner got a steal in greenpoint, $1500 for a 1 bed.. he moved in the week before covid..    been grinding in the city for 10 years 7 days a week, and still only reaping off his benefit 🤣🤣 i paid $550 by arthur ave in the bronx between 2017-2019. one bedroom in a 4 bedroom, eat in kitchen and one full bath shared apartment. the room was like 10 x 7 feet. furnished apartment and we still split electric and internet, so about another $35 a month.  found it on facebook, had my friend visit it with her mom. then sent a deposit via zelle to the owner before i’d even moved to new york. under 1k you’re re absolutely renting a room or have roommates. i pay 900 and have three roommates in bedstuy not far from pratt. it was actually just 800 when we first moved in during the omicron wave, because there was a low demand for housing at that point.  our place has lots of light, 2 bathrooms, is 1 block away from the subway, and 30 min to manhattan. the building kinda crusty though.. and the floors are super squeaky, but overall it's a good deal :) this is definitely a trap to see where the rest of the low rent payers been hiding lmfao i pay $1300.00 per month in the south shore of staten island - arden heights, electricity, gas and internet are separated for one bedroom apt with separate entrance on a house at the first floor.  next to me i got a park and some days i see deers in my area, you wont believe its nyc when you come to the south shore. queens, 3 bedroom, $3900. my neighbor rents rooms for $1200/month, rooms i pay $400 a month for an $800 a month apartment in bushwick with my boyfriend. it’s amazing i pay 1k . split a 2 bedroom apartment with my best friend i pay 500$ for a room in my parents  house pretty sure i’m getting a family discount though. you are delusional. average rent here is 4k i pay $0, but i live with my ex. so i basically pay $2000 for 2 bedrooms , in wash heights. no roommates. great steal, rent controlled building. rent control with grandma who passed away years ago. i pay about 1500 in sunset park bk for 2 bedroom, about 800 sq feet. first floor with backyard. i live alone. sounds like another bullshit puff piece from the times trying to convince people that the housing crisis isn’t as bad as it seems. apartment is $1500 on lease...a small ass studio in the hood of east new york. tells you how crazy rents are. i pay $0 though, if you know, you know.. have lived in crown heights in a massive partitioned-off private room that was formerly the grand living room in a family style pre-war townhouse for ten years now...      $650 / month. not one rent upgrade. most bodacious landlord ever.  ready to chat. and brag... i pay $740 a month in bk and before that i was paying $870 in long island city. $700 for one third of a flat in deep bk. $1,000 or less in less, hahaha if only you live with mommy and daddy! i pay $1400 in brooklyn for a studio apartment i live in a 1bd for $1100. found it on street easy, it was rent stabilized. i’m grateful to have a space to call my own i lived in a 3 br apartment in forest hills for 5 years, paying $700 a month.   just moved out recently after buying and gut renovating a 1br coop in kew gardens.  its not much but im a first gen immigrant. getting a green card thru work, then buying a property feels like ive made it in america i pay $0 because i moved in with my fiancée in his condo in the uws. his mortgage is about $6k-$7k/mo with low interest rates $952.42 rent stabilized 2 bedroom in brooklyn. $952.42 2 bedroom rent stabilized apartment in brooklyn. it’s still a really tight space for a family but we make it work somehow. does it have to be rent? what about a mortgage? my half of the mortgage & maintenance is $1000 a month in nyc. i paid my mom $1000 when i still lived with her in brooklyn, til i left for good 7 months ago. does that count? 😂 i pay under $800 for a studio. affordable housing. i will be living here till i die and they exhume my body. one very interesting thing i’ve seen in two different storage buildings in nyc is that it seems like some people rent $300-$500 storage spaces to actually live in. often times when i go to my own storage space i’ll walk by people watching tv or using their computer in their storage space with the door wide open, and with a bunch of clothes hanging from the storage roofs. strange and probably illegal but gotta credit those people for their resourcefulness lol saw some youtube video where usually the people that have these cheap spots are pretty old. got in super early with a rent control or something and lived there 20-30+ years i know somebody paying $700 for a 1 bed in ocean hill and then my partner and i paid $1400 for a 2 bed railroad in bushwick up until this past oct. (we moved into a true 2 bed). i know it’s over 1k, but still very good. nyt attempts to oust the last rent controlled nyers i was paying $600 for a basement apartment in astoria. it was at least 500ft  of space. i pay $1650 for a 1-br in greenpoint. happy to chat if that’s interesting enough. :) past 5 years i paid $800 in astoria, $875 in clinton hill, $925-$975 in prospect heights. two (different) roommates each place. lots of searching fb groups, craigslist, listservs. when landlords try to up the rent i negotiate and if they’re unreasonable i bounce.   rooms are generally v small at this price point (except for one room i had in clinton hill, which was massive but the building was falling apart ancient), but always had enough space for at least a bed, desk, drawers, small window. to me putting in that work is absolutely worth it for the extra money i can spend on enjoying the city and actually saving for my future. my mil pays less than that for a studio in forest hills. rent regulated that she inherited from her father. $800 for a room in bedstuy got it a year ago, big windows full dining room and living room, he’ll of a spot. i’m at 2,000 one bedroom in the upper east side, lenox hill. great deal and my apartment has amenities i pay less than a thousand for a room in a 3 bedroom lol you guys are about to expose the secret spots. don’t do it! $1150 is my personal rent for a spacious 2 bed in astoria ($2.3k total). i thank my lucky stars pretty often. $1120 a month, was paying $800 during the covid days rip  $800-$900 i’d say is a more justified price for my current apt. i pay around a 1000 up in washington heights. room? not very big but the rest is decent for its price. 2k 2 bedroom basement w a little backyard thing well guys, i just read how much you pay and i’m sooo jealous… i pay $518 for a sro in the lower east side. $300 my mom is my landlord 🫣 my mom pays $1500 for a three bedroom in nyc. she’s going to move soon because my uncle is going to give up the apartment since landlords are willing to pay anyone paying low rent. 1100$ a 1-bedroom apt in manhattan (heavily subsidized by the university where i work at) i'm a macroeconomist, that spends far too much time looking at street easy meta data numbers. new york's rental market is one where 3-bedroom+ apartments are the most cost effective per person. your article is going to be mostly about people with rent regulated apartments and have two or more roommates. or individuals who are lucky enough to have rent regulated apartments, old rent stabilized apartments or family that owns a building and rents on the cheap. i'm looking for an apartment in nyc, any low listings definitely not under $1000 a month because that’s hilarious, but i currently pay $2323 for a rent stabilized studio apartment in lic and that’s preferential rent. i got it because my landlord messed up during covid and didn’t give any renewing residents any concessions when other buildings nearby were doing 6 months free on a 2 year lease so basically all the residents left. so my landlord was desperate and willing to lower my legal rent and still gave me 2 months free my first year. it’s also a studio in a luxury building, so i’ve got washer dryer in unit and a bunch of free amenities i was paying $890 before i moved 800$ for a room inbay ridge. 1850$ total daughter moves in tomorrow to a one bed in the east village (near les) for $1700.03 which is rent controlled. was offered to view this unit (not formally on the market yet) by a broker who was showing her another smaller, more expensive studio. she will be paying less in rent to live alone than she was with a roommate in midtown. sheer dumb luck- i pay $982 monthly in harlem, found on fb marketplace! lollll good luck harlem. 800  shared bathroom, showerroom, shared kitchen, daily house keeper.   large enough for two apt. my grandparents have lived in the same apartment for decades. their rent was $900 for a two bedroom. they just moved to florida. my rent is $1,050. i make $1,600 a month. i’m terrified to look at my bank account and i’m watching my relationships deteriorate as going out has become associated with the pain of spending money. i have no energy from work, no concept of time, and a deepening sense of emptiness $950/month for a room with no natural light in a 5br/2ba in the middle of bed stuy since august 2023. i like it but i plan to move at the end of my lease. i live with my partner in lic. we share a one bedroom, rent stabilized. found it during covid. $2045. so $1000 each. $1000 or less per room (small) through the housing lottery, my 1br rent is stabilized, and rent is $4 short of $1k in the bronx. i’m pretty sure my late mom was paying <$500 a month in her 2bd 1ba in the les as recently as 2021. but she was on ssi (and before that on welfare) and in the crumbling nycha apartment she literally grew up in. i am lucky enough to pay $1000 for a 1 bedroom/bath in queens, main floor. the lady in the basement pays about the same and has lived here alone for about 20 years. a family member is the landlord and the original owner of the home, that is paid off.  most people with really good rents have mom and pop landlords that share the house, and value having trustworthy and good tenants (since nyc is not landlord friendly, thanks to corporate landlords)! not less, but $1,300 for a rent stabilized studio in queens. been here 11 years. was $1,025 when i moved in. before covid, my aunt, grandma and i lived in this very large 2 bedroom in the nice side of crown heights. my grandma had been a member of an income assistance program in the 80s. she lived in that apartment for 40 years. they paid $400 a month before i moved in and after i moved in it was 600 a month. that low rent enabled my aunt to buy a house in florida. hopefully i’m next! 904.05 but my rent is going up in june i pay 1,700 for a 800sqft rent stabilized apartment in the heart of astoria. i think i got a good deal asides from my elephant of an upstairs neighbor.",367,432,neutral,0.4959270358085632,799,i pay $1000 for a 1 bedroom in the bronx. i’m a single mom of two and i pay $1000 for a room in the park. i pay $1000 for a room in the park. i pay $1000 for a room in the bronx. i pay $1000 for a room in the bronx. i pay $1000 for a room in the park. i
33,Seeking Room for my Deli Guy (Brooklyn),"good luck to mo, rooting for him! [removed] this guy is just being nice let him be nice crabby ass new yorkers thanks for trying to help this man out! i love the way you’re building community.    some comments in the thread are pointing out some truths tho (despite being mad rude about it lol). it’s possible mo is already rly well connected so things will likely workout for him.   keep yourself safe and be a little more street smart about how you go about giving help/building community mo has managed to secure employment (earning $4400 a month) and housing (in one of the hardest places to find housing in the world) in just about a month of coming to america. that's incredible!   now think about how many new yorkers commute between bronx and brooklyn for a buck. did you know 1/3 of new yorkers have a commute of over 1 hour?   everyone in this city, regardless of income, status, or circumstance would love to live closer to their place of employment. everyone would love to work less hours for the same or more money.       so his situation is not as unique or unfortunate as you've been lead to believe. mo is actually doing really good for himself and his family. they now have hundreds if not thousands in usd coming in... after just a month! who knows what this man could accomplish in a year. let him do his thing. bro not going to lie.. he doesn’t even need you to make this post. dont let him fool you.. all he has to do is go to the masjid on utica & atlantic or the masjid on fulton.. (pretty sure his muslim) they will help him.. & plus his “boss” aka his cousin definitely knows someone.. first and foremost your friend needs help negotiating for more money. a man working 84 hours a week should be making a lot more than $ 4400.00 a month. even at $15.00 an hour he should gross about $ 6300+ a month. he is clearly being taken advantage of how would one get scammed in this situation? op just posting an ad- not paying the man’s rent this is so kind of you, i hope the right person sees this and help him out. living in brooklyn would be better for his mental and physical health. hey, 12 hour shift 7 days per week violates ny labor law https://dol.ny.gov/day-rest-and-meal-periods average non new yorker i moved here last sept. have not found a job yet though i'm fervently looking. accommodation? if not for my mom, i'd be in the streets.  mohammed obviously has a network that has assisted him in finding a job and accommodation all in the space of a month. at $4,400 a month, he's good! he's not punishing! an employer can't make you work hours that you don't want to. of course, there is the standard 40-hour week. racking up 84 hours a week is a choice not a requirement!   as for the commute, there are folks who travel from li, nj and as far away as connecticut each day to work in the city. his commute is not unique! of course, moving to bklyn will whittle down transportation costs so that he'll be able to have more disposable income.   that said, muslims, like jews, operate in a closed network and they always help their fellow muslims. as others have pointed out, mohammed is likely to be much better connected in this city than millions of others! nice to try and help!!!! this is cringe why doesn’t the op let mo couch surf a his place a couple nights a week ? 🤔 mo can always use a guarantor service like rhino or the guarantors instead of needing to make 40x rent+ credit score. they require a one time fee per year i believe. all the international students studying in nyc use a guarantor service due to their lack of income and credit score. why doesn’t he move in with you? dude u just moved here, worry about urself. mohammad absolutely has community i promise u. doesn’t need some new new yorker saving him from a commute (which, majority of nyc population does)  i’m confused if he’s even asking for help himself, or you just found someone to save mo must be classically trained in fiddle bc he’s playing you like one 😭😭😭",359,63,positive,0.7347253561019897,422,he can’t afford to live with you? he has community. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he’s not alone. he has community. he has friends. he has connections. he has community
34,Why is it so dang hard to find a place in this city???,"if you can wait till october the prices and demand will go down a little bit. looking for september is the worst for variety of reasons yep i’m also waiting till after sept, good luck then are you applying and getting denied for some reason or are places getting snatched out from under you before you have a chance to get your app considered? there are different ways to solve the problem depending on which one it is. if you’re getting denied because of issues with your application, it would be useful to know what the brokers say those issues are. you haven’t really outlined what specific obstacles you’ve come across, so it’s not likely anyone here is going to be able to give you any concrete advice/help.   you say you can’t find anything. what’s your budget? what neighborhoods are you looking in?   if it’s that difficult and money isn’t a major issue (as your comment about a large security deposit suggests) why not just hire a broker to do the work for you? now imagine how much harder people who don't make $125k have in finding a place. be the first to see and first to apply. set zillow/street easy alerts with your criterion, call agents  immediately, be at the first showing appt., have your laptop ready with all docs and apply at the coffee shop down the block after viewing. i’ve gotten 3 out of my 4 apartments here that way. well, one reason is because of the people like my building’s squatter:  he hasn’t paid rent since march 2022, he’s a hoarder, his friends ring all buzzers until someone lets them in, he’s a menace  so, yeah, once burned you never just *trust* that someone will pay rent  alternatively, everyone thinks ll’s are scum too  so here we are tenants have crazy rights in ny. one of my friends had two tenants that paid zero rent for 10 months during covid. they left after without paying a dime. since then, landlords are much more wary of who they rent to and that’s why they have ridiculous qualifications. set up an account on housing connect and start applying to lotteries, also check out hdc they have apartments that are available now.  https://www.nychdc.com/ i’m not sure exactly what you’re looking for but there are 5 apartments available on streeteasy now that match your basic criteria eviction takes like 1-2 years. they can’t just kick you out. that said, i’m sorry your have a difficult time. renting is crazy now yup if you want to find a place you're happy with it typically feels like a second job and you have to be very quick to act. you'll find something tho. they cant really just kick you if you stop paying rent. eviction is long and expensive for landlords because nyc is pretty strict with tenants rights. thats why most landlords are a pain in the ass when it comes to approving someone what are the challenges you’re facing? an able bodied 30’s man living next door to us hasn’t paid rent in well over two years and taken to court a dozen times and still they can’t get him out.  he told my tenant in our building to stop paying and he did - luckily i got him out in less than 6 months but it almost financially ruined us.  hope you find a place. it may suck...get 3rd party company to be your guarantor. one of my lower floor neighbors just moved...studio $4250.00 i agree that the 2019  deposit law really doesn't work for a lot of people, and i hope to see it changed.  would you consider working with an agent who represents you?  the agent can help polish and package your application, and often has experience with many landlords, that experience can help you improve your rate of application success.  look for clusters of listings, not outliers. i think a lot of people spin their wheels chasing a unicorn.  best of luck,  suzanne well.. what's decent credit? nyc has very tenant friendly laws. ever since the pandemic with tons of people not paying rent and eviction taking months even years. landlords are on edge especially mom and pop property owners . dont look in manhattan. try queens and brooklyn even some areas of the bronx hi op! also in atlanta and looking to move to the city soon :) honestly this post was a sign for me to just move to jersey right across the water. i wish you could just reserve an apartment online like they do here smh so difficult. good luck! this has been happening to us for an entire year. we have 10 grand in the bank; decent credit, and make a combined total of 90k. my gf moved into my room in an apt i share with 2 of the worst, most disgusting roommates you could imagine, thinking we’d be out in 3 months or so. it’s been a year almost exactly now, and while we’ve been a little picky so we don’t totally end up in a dump, this is proving to be incredibly stressful and depressing. recently, after 4 years of living here, it became normal to start seeing giant roaches for all the tenants here. the exterminator came today and left a half empty open end syringe of roach bait on the counter where the cat could’ve easily gotten it and potentially harmed. so getting out of here feels even more imperative. we got close with one place, but at the last moment the landlord decided that the only way he’d allow a cat is if it was declawed. obviously that’s illegal and stupid, so we lost out on that one. hope you find something good soon, and hopefully we will too. i can connect you with a great realtor if you need help? he got us in june which is one of the crazier months. i make less than that and i found an apartment i love after searching for 10 days. signed the lease yesterday. op i’m not sure what you’re doing but something is missing from this story   edit: read through the comments. op the only problem you have is your credit score. pay down those cards and in 2 weeks when they do the next update you will have a much easier time it’s been a rough market for a few years now and looking for apartments late-summer is the roughest time.   don’t despair, a lot of people land something last minute. i moved into an airbnb for like 6 months until february into a low season where competition was lower to get a good apartment.       even then i still had to literally tell the broker before viewing my apartment: i will give you a deposit immediately after viewing if it looks good and have my paperwork ready. i also saw the posting within 30 mins of it being posted, i was hawking street easy every hour for a good 2 weeks. you must be new here. supply and demand well, no they cannot kick you out for not paying. they can, but it takes at least a year lol extra security is not allowed.  a landlord can not even allow you to pay some rent upfront.   the state senate passed a bill that really only benefited the companies that insure leases.  at least with additional security or pre paying rent you benefited from that money. wait until oct or nov. landlords desperate to let go of inventory those months. respectfully, $125k ain’t much in nyc. you’re only qualified for up to $3100 assuming your credit is good. if it’s not great, you might be qualified only up to $2700.  if you’re applying for more expensive places try lower the budget going to get flamed, but if you’re really desperate, hire a broker. where are you looking? it shouldn’t be this hard. there must be something you’re not sharing. everyone and their mother wants to move here, get in line. do you have asian speaking friends? also if you’re not white that plays a huge part too, these landlord def be trying to fulfill an image vote these lawmakers out. half of the apartments in nyc are owned by small landlords who are not rich, and in the past have used a rental unit or two to help with expenses and frankly, help others have a nice place to live too. the laws have made it impossible for small landlords to rent their apartments. it's not worth the risk of getting a bad tenant so they are now used as guest rooms, home offices, and the occasional short-term rental to friends and family. this is the sad truth. have you looked into the listings project? the agora will take you  https://www.theagoranyc.com/?keyword=the%20agora%20brooklyn&gad_source=1&gbraid=0aaaaa9z_dncn5hrk-ygbsmdc5ezfbtfug&gclid=cjwkcajwnk60bha9eiwamphzw_yhjagy4nf9cb1tcgc1edq5amia08askdku13hxbu-j2xldm4rqnbocaioqavd_bwe because eviction laws in nyc let bums hang around for over a year. i just walked by another unit in my building who evidently hasn’t paid rent and there was a letter on the door saying he or she owed almost $45k. i always move in december. great deals. i had this same issue last summer- my dm’s were a graveyard of ghosted messages. finally landed a spot in harlem, a little out of budget but my own place and i absolutely love it. took me moving out here without a home, just a friends house to stay at for a few weeks before i finally landed something for oct. it’ll happen for you! just might take a little longer 🫶🏻 low inventory. if you’re using airbnb i’d suggest looking on furnished finder until you find something more permanent. way cheaper than airbnb bc no fees. >why cant i just move in and pay you the fucking rent and live happily ever after?!why cant you just kick me out if i dont pay?! why is it complicated?  this may have something to do with nyc being one of the most anti-landlord place in the union. you’ll need to “bribe” some realtors and landlords this aint for the weak... survival of the fittest don't do airbnb in this city. you can likely save more if you sublet through listingsproject.com. [deleted] cause it’s new york not to freak you out, but i started looking in september of last year. found the place in november. moved in by december. i was about to give up and sleep on a friend's couch when finally i snagged my place. what’s your budget and are you looking for a roommate? my gay male friend needs a roommate for sept 1 in south slope brooklyn. 1800 for a bedroom, private bathroom, great amenities. feel free to dm me if you’re interested! demand is higher in the summer.   you also may have more luck outside of “trendy” neighborhoods. there are nice and safe neighborhoods in brooklyn and queens that are easier to find a spot in and cheaper but just, not that exciting and maybe a longer commute. if you need some ideas i can help but ultimately it depends where you work and what you need you can thank new york and new york city’s insane “pro tenant” laws and regulations that ironically make renting so much more difficult. it’s complicated because it’s hard to evict bad tenants. hire a broker? [leasebreak.com](http://leasebreak.com) is a good option for your first place in nyc, since you don't have to formally apply through the landlord / management company, and lots of listings on there are advertising asap move-ins. you may not get a place on there for a full year, but you'll have your roots in the ground. then you can take your time finding a more permanent place. look outside manhattan; queens, jersey city move to new jersey or new rochelle live by a train station people there are other places besides nyc try tri state $125k is not enough especially in manhattan brooklyn queens and harlem most of these places want roommates for the apt!!! one person is a risk to landlords finding an apartment to rent is from june until september. but august many go away before labor day. have you tried outside the city? westchester, long island, new jersey? not sure what you’re going through but it’s been easy this year to find a place compared to past years. just check out streeteasy overcrowding long term tip. move into a building with an institutional landlord that owns several buildings. you can get a studio or 1 bed to “get in the door”. then you can move into a larger unit type down the road and your approval process will be much easier. you can also get off of the summer cycle, which is the most expensive. example is we moved from a 1 bedroom (august maturity) to a 2 bedroom in our building where we had a new 12 month lease at november. then every year, the renewal was easy since it was off peak season. make sure your landlord allows you to move within their system first. my brother in christ air bnb ate up too many apartments lol i have a 2bd lease takeover with flexible move in in williamsburg for 4583 net and $600 extra signing incentive! lmk if you’re interested i’m a broker who focuses on rentals if you need help. maybe just advice, cause $125k and you should be able to find a decent home with credit in september you are competing with all the nyu students whose parents sometimes pay the rent up front for a year if they are from out of country. because the city that you live puts a lot of stress and potential loss if they rent to the wrong person when are you moving? you can have my 1br if you can wait until december/january, i'll be subletting i’m renting my second bedroom if anyone is interested (please be interested) people are always coming to nyc looking for opportunities i'm going to be nice and let you in on the secret.  westchester but not the expensive areas have you looked on facebook groups while you clean your credit up? get your fico up to 720 and it will open a field of new opportunities.   another option you have is to filter ""rent by owner"" on streeteasy and see if you can negotiate direct with owner, explain your situation and see what you can make happen.   another option - i would assume nj would be easier to get approved, so maybe look at renting in jersey city / hoboken for the first 6 months to 1 year if you're so so itching to have a solid home base without roommates, then go rent in manhattan/other boroughs once fico is up.   again, the main thing is to focus on your credit get that nice and gucci so you're approved wherever. in the meantime do a roommate or keep on using airbnb. you can find some pretty sweet deals on airbnb so its good u have that option.   and congrats on your job and new chapter. try and enjoy this moment even if it does come with frustrations, you're in nyc and have a great new source of income, throw yourself into the delights of city life, go to a pottery class, go see a show on broadway, go indulge in the delicious food places and enjoy. i went through all the comments and your story, and i hope you find something. i just rented an apartment, and i felt i had a fairly weak application seeing how new york is. i have over 800 credit, income like yours, but a brand new job, no past new york rental history, and with my partner who doesn’t have his green card yet. i found that a lot of places, especially downtown, endless open houses and keep the $20 application fees, apparently without ever considering or checking your credit. they let that go on for a while and make their money, and then choose the wealthiest applicant. open house in the east village had 50 people,for a shitty tiny studio. i put into applications and never even got replies, turning me down or accepted me. finally, another building on the upper east side that we liked, the agent was kind, but we still got bumped on our first choice by a stronger applicant. btw, i wasn’t willing to use a guarantor or pay a broker fee.credit score, you might want to call one of the guarantee companies and see what they say. i still remember in february when i applied for my apartment listed on the same day. the next day i paid the security deposit and the apartment was retired from the market. not even a day in the market. i’ve moved 3 times during summer now. feel free to dm me for some buildings i know that are very fast with rental requests.   some tips for apartment hunt: your income is more than qualified for so many nyc apartments. when you come across them on streeteasy/platforms, look up the building website, call or email their office directly. if it’s a condo, you will have to contact the agent. i have a 95% response rate when i reach out because i make sure to have a short but warm greeting and i list my qualifications right the way- salary, type of unit i’m looking for, move in date, guarantor situation, etc.   condos takes longer to approve and typically comes with fees that could be $3+k non refundable just to move in. if the building is a rental then they’re usually a lot faster and cheaper  edit: if you have a 630 credit score i highly recommend you maybe sublet from someone for a long period of time then build your score more to close to 700. my husband and i have 740-750 credit scores. experian boost can help. a monthly fee but can use charges like streaming, insurance pay to boost your credit. nyc is becoming unlivable your trying to move into a social class you probably don’t belong.  i know this because the only place i was easily accepted was in bushwick.  making 200 k a year. i’m ecuadorian. and nobody wants me living anywhere near them in their stupid high rises in manhattan. fuck it. is this helpful for you?

35,Want to move back,"it’s not the same - it really hasn’t been the same since lockdown. you might want to get a room for a month to see if it’s still what you envision, before committing to a move and the drama of nyc rentals. can someone please give a detailed breakdown of what has changed so drastically since lockdown? i know price has gone way up, but i left in 2021 and every time i go back i miss it. but i feel like i must be missing something? the bronx is still real nyc. has been the only place that embodies the old spirit of nyc for a while now, well before covid. a lot of people say they want the real nyc but don't want to go to the bronx, even to visit, which calls the whole premise into question  (please don't gentrify the bx) everywhere is too expensive. everywhere is fucked. everything “used to be cooler.”  there now that we’ve given all these sad and lame nyc peeps a cookie, dude definitely come back if that’s what you want. in life, you mostly regret the things you don’t do.   there’s plenty of great shit happening here and plenty of opportunity here compared to what, ohio? it’s tough out here ngl. i grew up here and have bounced all around brooklyn. pre covid and slightly after, like 2021, i never had an issue finding an apartment on my income which wasn’t anything crazy (at most 80k gross income). when i had the best income and best credit score i’ve had, i wouldn’t get approved for apartments. now it’s impossible to even get a viewing. and lots of housing scams that people not from here wouldn’t be able to sus out. the house less crisis is also the worst i’ve seen in my adult life. it’s really sad to see people suffering. people are a little more unhinged and businesses/landlords are constantly looking for a money grab for stupid things. i love new york and i probably will never leave but it’s getting hard out here. i think it’s partially eric adams, partially people just saying fuck it and doing what they want recklessly, and a lot of gentrification. lots of people are moving here for a year or two, then moving after jacking up the rentals and working from home where they could’ve been working from anywhere. (not to mention, big corporations attracting these kinds of people like flies on shit) i have hope that things will even out eventually 🤞  my final note is that city jobs (sanitation, fdny etc) aren’t keeping up with inflation, their contracts are either delayed or not great, and hiring has either been put to a pause or a massive hiring while firing the older guys who have put in their time. all that in saying, they don’t care about their jobs as much so things are slipping on a fundamental level. crazy hours and less than a living wage unfortunately. i can only speak from the friends i have in those jobs. we pay a lot to keep this city running, and it seems like mta is getting more unsafe and unreliable.  however! community has been a light in a dark tunnel for me. i mostly only frequent small businesses and support my friends as much as possible. best of luck if you decide to move back! a sublet to start might be the easiest option if you’re not super wealthy or have some factors against you. i moved to nyc in 1991, as an actor wannabe. moved away in 1998 for a job. moved back in 2005 because i wanted to be back. moved again for a job in 2012 and then just moved back again. all my friends who moved here with me in 1991 and are still here warned me that it is super different. i still came, i mean it’s just life and you have to see what it has for you and if you don’t like it, move again. that’s really all.  and i’ve moved and lived here in squalor and in better circumstances. and all on my own, no help from parents or whatever. just go for it. it’s not because now everywhere is like nyc 2019 price that nyc stayed with 2019 prices. prices are very well 2024 nightmare and nowhere near what it was in 2019. listen bruv, you left, time to go to kansas city. why not just visit and see for yourself? that's the best way to do a vibe check. bay ridge is still affordable compared to other areas of the city. safe, some good restaurants, has a suburban feel on the residential streets while having the conveniences of city life. i’ve been in manhattan (between houston and 96th street) since 2014.  here are the biggest changes i’ve noticed:  - a lot of local / mom-and-pop businesses have closed. covid accelerated this trend, but in line retail is just generally tough in a vhcol city - the amount of homeless and african refugees loitering on the streets is very palpable since covid - cost of living has gone up substantially.  not a surprise, but the same 1 bed apartment that i lived in with a friend was $3450 and now rented for $4900. just one data point but that’s 42% in 10 years.  - you have to be very alert when walking around. e-bikes, scooters, etc. have increased the amount of “vehicles” on the road.  not sure if there’s been a notable increase in injuries, but you really have to pay attention.  - outdoor dining after covid is a permanent fixture with sidewalk sheds taking up lots of space. couple that with local law 11 (scaffolding for buildings) and everything feels a lot more crowded.  - city feels the same level of dirty as always.  subways are dank in the summer and service is equally unreliable on certain lines and weekends.  - wages for most industries (excluding tech, finance, post professional) have not kept pace with effective inflation in nyc, meaning that they may have kept pace with cpi, but nyc costs rise much more than cpi - nyc budget has not materially changed in terms of what types of programs are funded.  mayors have been largely ineffective in pushing any sort of real agenda for progress. i agree with others that the vibe has been off since the pandemic. lots of spots closed down, others reopened but it’s just not the same. the city seems like a shell of itself. it also has a melancholy vibe to it, i don’t know how to explain it. i have a two bedroom in harlem for a steal. message me if you are interested. why would you want to go back?? and no, not everywhere is as expensive as nyc. that's crazy talk. where i live now it's almost like 40% cheaper than nyc...and it's a nice area, very little crime, super friendly laid back people. crime is rampant. probably not the city you left. the biggest thing that’s different is that 24hr things are gone. which is genuinely sad.  other than that, i still love the city and actually think things are pretty nice here. been here 20 years and counting. i have been in the same 3 block radius in the ues for the last 20 years. yes, half the stores are empty,  100% more homeless neighbors, dirtier, more rats, rent is double and all, but i couldn’t imagine for the life of me where i’d go. nyc is always going to be a step up for me vibe is off. i left in 2020 after almost 15 years in manhattan. i’ve also debated moving back but leaning towards jc   -  lots of cool places shut down and are either abandoned or replaced with the same commercial stuff in your crappy town in midwest america especially in manhattan and williamsburg.  - everything is even more expensive including rentals and eating out -  everyone seems to go out earlier and come home earlier. after work is is literally 5:30 till 8 when before we would not get there to lol 8 -  you’ll still see ppl out evenings but it feels like less people (prob cause where folks hang is more spread out) -  folks are moving further into brooklyn and queens which means everyone is more spread out, commutes are very long if you work in manhattan (i don’t want to pay more to have an hour commute instead of a short walk)  -  loads of mom and pop shops closed -  evrerything feels super commercial. cool places are run by influencer community.   it’s still nyc and better than loads of places in the us -  food from all over the world, fun events to go to etc i’m you but the opposite. i moved to ny because denver got too expensive. i just found a really great room in a 4 bed in prospect lefferts gardens through the site spareroom. you may wanna take a look through there, it’s a lot of people offering up rooms they’re vacating but still has someone else living in the unit, so prices seem to be fairer there. in my case, i’m signing on what’s basically an independent lease through the agency, and i’m not responsible for filling the other 3 rooms, which is a huge load off my shoulders. feel free to dm me if you have any other questions i just moved back to bushwick in dec after being away for 5 years (was here 8 years before that). nyc has always been what you make of it. people saying it’s different are choosing that reality. if you want to be here, be here. if you thought the city was expensive than, just come stay here for a week.  somehow the city makes a few improvements, but with a lot of setbacks. you could try astoria. lots of older apartments and those are generally cheaper than new. if you don’t tell us the max you can afford, it’s hard to make suggestions.   but you could look at maspeth, south ozone park, brownsville, or east new york to start. staten island, morrisania / west bronx as well. the neighborhoods where people live who worked from home during covid thrived. businesses opened to cater to those folks who no longer had to commute to manhattan. look in the outer boroughs. look where rents are cheap(ish). lower income creatives and do gooder sorts are going to be paying the lower rents and moving into shares. higher income finance and tech types will move into the higher priced places. if i could i would be out of new york. tired of my paycheck going to such high taxes new york smells like shit and urine everywhere..the homeless and drugs addicts everywhere...its fake hype on tv so midwesterners take the bait and get fooled intonsharing rooms with strangersnin apartments for 4k jersey city is what's happening there's still tons to do in the city, free events everywhere if you put in any effort to find them. covid hurts everything and, yes,  the city is getting more expensive, but there's still a lot that makes new york special. the yorkville neighborhood of the upper east side can still be decently affordable by nyc standards. washington heights can be pretty cheap too if you're willing to commute farther but still be in manhattan. nomad guy here. ny sleeps now. :(  more homeless. more crime. more people doing drugs on the sidewalks. and there are a lot of people sleeping in tents now. in my area about 4 different spots have “regulars”. in some areas bars are empty by 2am. :(. places used to be very busy until 4am. overall more unsafe city. subway, streets, even parks are not safe anymore (or, i should say less safe). subway is dangerous now. expect to get harassed more than half of the times you use the train outside work hours (9~5).  a lot of racist people (whom are usually heavier than average people (i’m 170lbs)), whose aggressions towards people are justified by “mental issues” by city officials. still, a beautiful city. you definitely have to be more careful now. but us, who love this city will always want to be here. so you should move back. just be aware. :) also, it’s jammed packed. it’s so many people here, certain neighborhoods are unbearable with the amount of people there now (i’m thinking jackson heights, corona, flushing, dyckman, washington heights, downtown brooklyn) come back.  we miss you.  i’ve been there since 2018, and nothing has changed for me.  i’m living my best life and enjoy it very much much.  my church, my gym, central park, my friendships, and social activities make this place 2nd to none.  i walk to work in midtown.  i also very much enjoy restaurants, broadway and lincoln center.  like any other city, new york is not perfect.  you gotta take the bad with the good. but overall, new york is better than ever. brooklyn or queens best bet. you should list your budget. appalachia is cheap and west virginia.  east ny in brooklyn too! new york turned into ohio. i live in williamsburg and my other foot is in manhattan for events and stuff and i really like it. i wouldn't agree that nyc is worse than before. post covid, it is coming back to its natural state. i like the hustle bustle of the city  it's not for everyone. speaking about rents we have been looking to move and astoria has soelme good apartments for rent. so does a couple of other places. dm me if you want to discuss specifics. this city is fun and the best city in the world! good luck and welcome back! i just spent a hellish two months looking for a place. i was denied at every single one. at each and every apartment i went to see there was a line of about 30-70 ppl to see the same apartment. i finally went with a month to month place until i can get a better spot. i now pay 1,500 and live with 4 other ppl. you will not find a decent apartment and everything is vastly different here since 2019. i would do anything to go back to five years ago. nothing is open 24 hours anymore, the grocery stores are all insanely expensive, the mta is fucked, the whole vibe is entirely fucked. tbh it feels like l.a now, unless you move to williamsburg or queens ridgewood. it’s right next to bushwick. trains, buses etc go there, it’s coming up right now with new restaurants and bars but very affordable neighborhood for nyc.  also, slightly more but still great bang for buck rn is chinatown or specifically the east broadway area in manhattan.  i’ve been in the city for 16 years. first year in the bronx, next 4 in manhattan and last 11 in brooklyn. brooklyn by far is my favorite (especially if on budget). i moved to nj and don’t regret it. i still work in nyc and if i ever go out in the city i stay by hudson yards. nyc isn’t as enjoyable as way back. too many crazies walking on the streets and the subway it’s 🤮. the mayor isn’t doing much either so unruly folks do what they want. i came in 2018, enjoyed 2 years of kinda normal nyc, experienced it slow to a death crawl during covid, then watched it return to what it is now.   it's a great place.   this thread reminds me of how everyone told me visiting paris during the olympics would be a terrible idea because it wouldn't be the classic city. and it wasn't, but it was more than close enough, and a completely wonderful time. frankly, people worry too much and are too negative. use a roommates finder or commute from the suburbs. yes everything is expensive now so take what something costs where you live now and add 40% because in nyc costs went up at the same rate or faster than everywhere else. so moving back because everything is more expensive doesn’t  really make sense. cost of living in nyc is still about 85% higher than the national average amongst a lot of my coworkers, ppl seem to be staying in brooklyn, queens, and jersey city more. nyc still the best place on earth. people angry about overly priced areas that have been long gone for 10+ years. tons of smaller outer borough neighborhoods still liveable and “affordable”. trains running smooth. summer vibes still strong. perfect fall weather right around the corner. job market is boomin. small minded people who can’t live outside the box commenting about the city being dead. yes it’s gotten horribly expensive in some areas. yes certain neighborhoods have lost its joy due to overcrowding rich suburbanites who move to nyc for 2/3 years then leave. l train riders commenting about a city they don’t know 90% of. moved to nyc in 2016 so i’m not claiming to be a native or lifelonger or whatever. with that said so many people claim it changed “during the pandemic” and it did! things change! the city is going to be constantly evolving. imo it’s not better or worse it’s just different. you still won’t find anywhere like it in the states.   fwiw i’m a 29 year old, 90 pound woman, and i still feel safer in nyc than i do a lot of other places in the us washington heights after three years away, i am moving back. i grew up there and it’s always been changing. i am not bothered in the least at big pharmacy chains leaving nyc as i couldn’t stand that there was one on every other block for a while. nyc still has a rhythm and feel that’s unlike any city in the world that i have been to. people love to hate on it, it’s a tough ass place to be, but the payoff is worth every subway delay and hot summer puddle stench. been living in south florida and it sucks ass. same kinds of urban frustrations with non of the advantages nyc offers. …and this is how i ended up living in new jersey in 2018 when my wife and i moved back from texas readings these comments got me depressed lol real talk, the fact that the major complaint on this thread is about pedestrian safety is evidence of how drastically nyc has changed since the 70s, 80s, and even 90s. the city is a lot worse than before but still pretty good. if you think everything everywhere is expensive, you haven't been to nyc recently. it's on a whole 'nother level. a 1-bed that was $3300 in 2019 is going to be $5000 now okay i actually live in manhattan and have lived here since 2018. the city went through a bit of a dip during the pandemic but that has literally completely changed. new stores and restaurants are opening literally all the time and the city has gotten cleaner by a mile. the vibe is also better than 2019 because pre pandemic people didn’t really care too much about their surroundings and now people are much more likely to be kinder on first impressions and also way more alert to people’s personal space. i live in hell’s kitchen and when i saw in 2019 i didn’t feel that safe at all and now i literally walk around at night daily and it’s great. people are correct that things are expensive but it’s honestly not much more expensive than 2019. rent for sure has gone up but like you said it’s gone up in the whole country. nyc gives you the energy you give back to it. so if you’re coming with good vibes and to genuinely enjoy yourself and the city then you’ll love it! events constantly, new food halls, gyms, parks, and activities opened this year and many more opening in the fall and in 2025. if you don’t actually live in manhattan or around the more popular bustling areas of brooklyn the yes you are going to feel like things have stayed the same but more expensive. but the rest of the city they are dumping money into and it’s been amazing to experience. just hosted my in-laws for a month and they literally are trying to move here now. nyc flatlined in 2020. expensive is the norm. it’s the lack of respect and audacity on top of the expense; paying more for way less and low quality. the real nyer’s are mostly gone and no matter where you live in the city or outer boroughs, the quality of living space, and non compliant landlords who ignore deplorable conditions within their properties just adds to the overall. are you looking exclusively in manhattan? i think forest hills/rego park area has good value. the area is good and offers good access to public transportation plus a lot of the units are bigger than new apartments coming up. most new 1 bedrooms in nyc are lucky to be 500 sqft. my 1 bedroom apartment is 600-700 sqft and the building was renovated not too long ago so it’s still a modern looking apartment for less than $3k i grew up here and my life has been charmed - and even i regret not getting out. move anyplace and start new york over as this one is unrepairably  broken  in the near future. i’d pick new orleans stay where you are or find another city [removed] hey, if you’re looking, i’m a nyc realtor and would be very happy to help you find a place. cheap places all over the city, no broker’s fee, etc. let me know! staten island is the way depends which neighbor you came from and what neighborhood you're trying to get into.  the bronx is getting rough besides riverdale.  brooklyn is getting rough besides greenpoint and dumbo.  queens is getting rough unless ne queens past flushing.  manhattan getting rough.  unless

36,Rent increase of nearly 90%. Is this legal??,"[deleted] she’s due 60 days notice for an increase over 5% but that’s about it. yes of course, it's legal if it isn't rent stabilized. the increase is most likely legal for a market rate apartment, but keep in mind that there is a legally required notice period for the increase to take effect. if she has lived there for at least one year, the landlord is obliged to give a minimum of 60 days notice for that amount of an increase, and that increase can only take effect on the first day of the monthly rental period (i.e. if her original lease began on the 1st of the month and notice was given today, then the earliest the increase would be effective is june 1st.) there is no cap on non rent stabilizing apartments unfortunately if it isn't rent stabilized, it's legal.... it sucks, it's scummy, the landlord is a piece of shit, but it's legal. they want to collect over 100k per year in rent on a 2 bed lmao that’s so wild. if the neighborhood market rate is about $4500 then your gf could just move right? completely legal and awful! tell them to review the landlord on openigloo on future renters can know she was displaced because of this inhumane increase don't need any other details. not rent stabilized = they can raise it a much as they want. that is huge though. has she had any issues there? i kind of doubt the ll/owner actually thinks they'll get that much. they might just be trying to kick her out. the nasty response is don’t agree to the new rent and make them spend money to evict you through the courts you will never have to pay the higher rent unless you agree to it and you might be surprised about how much you can prolong the process. ideally the ll gets to a point where they pay you to leave. fuck em typical scumgang landlord yeah, it’s absolutely legal… “market price” does not matter in anything and isn’t a real value, it fluctuates.   tell her she’s gonna have to move if she doesn’t wanna pay it.   there’s a chance the owner just doesn’t want to keep your girlfriend and her roommates in that apartment for one reason or another and he offered them a ridiculous amount just so they would leave or over pay. if you're not sure if the apartment is rent stabilized, this site will tell you how to find out: https://www.nyc.gov/site/mayorspeu/programs/rent-stabilization.page tell you gf she can reach out to the management company and try to negotiate a lower price.   but they may only go down like $1k... but you'll never know unless you ask. it’s unfortunate there’s no real protection for tenants to live somewhere longer than a short lease without this happening. a lot of states do have caps on how much you can raise the rent when the lease ends. housing gets so shady here why wouldnt it be legal?! if it’s an old building, you should get the rent history, see how it ended up being unstabilized. that is ridiculous. who can afford that?! sounds like it isn't stabilized and your landlord listed at the wrong price and is adjusting aggressively. they can play with the price for a few weeks and find some one new. what your gf should do is shop for comps and then counter the new landlord. they might bite unless there is someone that has rented the unit, if it is that competitive after all. that's literally 1/5 of my yearly salary per month, what the fuck is going on down there? now we understand why tenants destroy properties out of spite. pretty inhumane and sick to increase it like that and having zero protections from this violent financial abuse. welcome to new york! where even locals are getting displaced and moving to places like florida and philly due to rent increases only option is to move.  greedy landlord. “is this legal” lmao yes unfortunately i went through a same issue when i moved to nc. the apt i was looking at i was quoted $950 a month for a 1 bed. 2 weeks later a new company bought the property and rent was $1500 for the same unit. it's both the developers' jacking price up and also people paying the asking price . all that's happening is a price gouging war. there is nothing to do with rent stabilization if it isn’t rent stabilized, yes. happened to us back when there was a low vacancy rate in another decade. that’s when we gave up and moved to riverdale. as long as she gave enough notices it's 100% legal. your girlfriend landlord wants her to move out and i would dealing with shitty landlords like that is not worth it. just move yes, it's legal, but they do have to provide appropriate notice for a rent increase of 5% or more as follows:  a nyc landlord may raise the rent of a month-to-month tenant with the consent of the tenant. however, if the tenant does not consent, the landlord can terminate the tenancy by giving appropriate notice.   [housing stability & tenant protection act (hstpa) of 2019](https://rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us/resources/rent-regulation-laws/rent-laws-of-2019/) requires landlords to provide tenants with written notice if they intend to raise the rent by at least 5% or if the landlord decides not to renew your lease. specifically:  * if a tenant has occupied the unit for less than one year, or does not have a lease term of at least one year, a 30-day notice is now mandatory. * a 60-day notice is required for tenants who have lived in an apartment for more than one year, but less than two years, or have a lease of at least one year, but less than two years. * tenants who have lived in a unit for more than two years, or have a lease of at least two years, must get a 90-day notice. there should be a 10% cap on raising rent for any building with 6 or more units. this shit is not sustainable with developers taking advantage of this and making stupid amounts of money for fucking housing, a necessity. seems to me she’s making up a story so that you two move in together…  kidding. yes legal, yes sucks. not sure about market rent depends on neighborhood and building. $8500 for a 2br seems about right based on what i’ve been running into. it sounds like she has to move . it’s legal remain in the apartment and pay the exact same rent. maybe make an offer to pay an increased rent in exchange for a lease. if they reject that, then keep sending the rent checks. if the landlord cashes those checks then you are still a legal tenant. if they don't, then they'll be planning on giving you notice to vacate which they have to send to you certified mail. stop paying the rent and cancel any uncashed checks. wait until they actually take you to court - and that could take a really long time in ny. keep banking your rent money. on the day you go to court, the judge will ask you to please try and work out a deal with the landlord to leave. do it. give the landlord a move out by date and be prepared to vacate before that date. the most important thing is to not get an actual legal eviction on your record because that will sink your credit ratings. with any luck the landlord will be happy that you're definitely leaving and you will have saved up more than enough cash to move and your credit will be intact. is this the building between 89th and 90th on uws? it’s so fucked up what they’re doing there. legal as long as they give her proper notice (30 days for everyone, 60 days if you’ve been there 2 years, 90 days if 3+ years) even if it was rent stabilized, a lot of landlords actually rent at a lower rent. we had an apartment we paid 4500 a month for but the rent stabilized cap was ~8500. no one would ever pay that, they kept jacking up the rent stabilized cap every year and giving tenants preferential rent, they got the tax benefits of have rent stabilized apartments but it's essentially market rate no i don’t think that’s legal. there’s a limit to how much you can increase on the same tenant (jared kushner’s firm was infamous for making apartments unlivable to drive out tenants to jack up rents). tell to move to jersey. we pay less than 4.5k for a mansion with 12 beds and 4bath yes try to negotiate the new landlords are delusional if they think someone will pay that much for it \[sigh\] $4500/month...unbelievable. i will never understand why people are so adamant on living in a place like nyc with those kinds of prices. i lived in north dakota for six years and had a great life in a small but cozy apartment that cost me only $350/month. didn't even have to share a bathroom.  it's amazing how great your quality of life can be when you don't have to worry about how to pay your rent every month. how else will we fund the slaughter of palestinians? real question is why the hell is your gf paying $4500 in rent. gotta love gentrification pushing out the original gentrifiers lol nahhh i’m squatting atp 4500 for 2br is very inexpensive for most of manhattan that's insane, that's 4x more than my mortgage on my 4000 sq ft house that's 45 miles north of nyc in tuxedo, ny..   i remember when i used to live in the city and paid close to $2.5k for a 2bed/2bath apartment in the bronx but that was nearly 15 years ago, but i digress  time to move outta the city and get a mansion at those prices... just my .02 cents [deleted] i’d recommend taking a vacation south of the border, and just walking in without providing papers. your girlfriend should be given free housing and food.   unfortunately, an increase of 89% seems quite reasonable. this is an extremely strong economy, and in order for bidenomics to work this well it needs to be cut throat. do not pay until you check the legality. 4,500 for a 2bd is really really low. last i checked, market for a 2bd was at least 6-7, depending on area. 8500 seems maybe a touch high but i don’t know the area. 8500 for a 2bd in areas like west village is totally normal if it's priced to market value then you've no right to call the owner greedy.  besides, you have no lease and let that go, and that's just plain stupid. it is not legal to increase rent that much.  they can not increase greater than 3.25%.",351,258,negative,0.7882481217384338,609,? i'm in new york and it's legal. i was quoted $950 a month for a 1 bed. 2 weeks later a new company bought the same unit and rent was $1500. i was displaced. i'm in nc and it's legal. i'm in california and it's legal. i'm in nyc and it's legal.
37,I have some advice for NYC apartment seekers after making my first apartment listing!,"thank you for the helpful write up!! this all rings true to me as someone who’s been on both sides of this in nyc lately. there’s a definite art to writing a good note applying for an apartment, as well as the follow through you have to have (people talk, money walks).   the market is bonkers right now. i went to check out a least takeover i found on listings project today and it was a total cattle call, even though he said we were on a “short list” of people he’d selected who reached out. can’t imagine how he’s going to pick the lucky winner! i remember that guy from earlier, and your post, and almost stepped in but it looked to be tapering off. appreciate the write up and giving people an insight into a different side of things. i agree with pretty much everything you said. reddit can be a very hostile, nasty place at times. you should see the abuse i take on here on the regular for being a broker and moderating this sub i rented an amazing huge 2 bed/2 bath apartment with outdoor space and pay $2800. i basically did all of the things on this list and beat out 1000 applicants.  the only thing different is that i included a cover letter and financial summary to my app to make it extra profesh and personalized. i wanted to ensure they knew i had the money and that i'm not a psycho.  so yes, this fucking works. i feel very lucky i was able to rent in the off season. didn’t have as much headaches as you all seem to be having. i would upvote this ten times if i could. you got a one day crash course in being a real estate agent. and yes it is very strange being suspected of being a scammer.  anyhow thanks for telling it like it is! this is great & i wish more people understood what you wrote. it’s exactly what i would tell anyone when looking for housing. esp that first messsge. ‘hi is this unit available. income 100k, 780 credit, 50k+ in assets, no pets, looking for 8.1 move date - can view today anytime after blah or tomorrow from blah to blah’ that will always get a better response than a blank message or just a ‘hi is this available?’  sadly tho the perpetual victim hood of maga has taught people to find others who will alter their behavior based on how you interpret a situation. if one can convince themselves they you are the victim, when a situation doesn’t go their  way - boom proof of victim hood. and if it does go their way, they know they’ve found someone who responds to that sort of language & will use it against them at every turn.   alas - as you see from the folk who get upset cause you didn’t respond to their precious inquiry in their time frame just shows how out of touch people are & how myopic they can be about anything else but their needs & wants. tbh your experience is why brokers exist. what owner would want to put up with all of that? this a great post and a much needed reality check for some people, i’m sure.  the housing market is absolutely fucked here. i found my current spot because the ad had been on cl for 14 minutes, scheduled a showing for that same day and showed up with my checkbook, income verification etc met and vibed with the “head tenant” and other roomies for a bit.   super lucky for sure but fortune favors the prepared. is it still available? i am going away this weekend but can come by to view on monday. so few listings are listed *by* the landlord. i would write a personable note with some background of how i lived in my apartment in a small house for 17 years and my landlord died and i wanted to stay in the same nabe. it always felt like ‘yeah, and?’ then when i did meet a few landlords, it didn’t seem like they cared that much. so that was a little discouraging but your tips make me realize i should keep doing it. thanks so much!! it’s scary reading what you wrote tho’!  eta: the system is so broken and all the focus on luxury housing and how rent stabilized landlords have been able to raise rents $$ has contributed in such a profound and tragic way. i feel like no steps are being taken politically to address this crisis. fantastic post, op. tracks with my experience as a 1 property landlord in another state and renter here in ny.   the first couple points are the most important like you said. being nice could push you from “almost there” to over the line. it’s also the decent thing to do.  people say be nice to your servers, it makes a difference. it’s because they are human. it’s also a human sorting the requests.    to the flamer(s) saying income and timing are all that matters, both can be true. you have landlords / agents with varying levels of investment and egos. thanks for sharing your experience. i’d offer that this can be simplified to a set of basic principles which apply in any hot market (jobs, home sales and rentals, cars, etc):  1. be a good human. whether you’re dealing with a faceless corporate office, real estate agent, or self-managing landlord, you’re dealing with or through an individual person with agency over your outcome. be courteous, pleasant, and respectful of their time.  2. be timely. inquire as soon as you discover a potential rental. have your documentation ready to produce on demand. reply immediately to communications. take the earliest showing you can get. you can’t control how quickly others jump on the listing but if/when you have the rental agent’s attention, you want to capitalize on that to make as much progress as possible, as quickly as possible, to move yourself down the funnel.  3. communicate clearly. write well. use spellcheck.  structure your email or text for legibility. introduce yourself and lead with your ask(s). anticipate follow up questions to eliminate extra back-and-forth. household income, credit score, dates, roommates, pets… you can wait to be asked or you can proactively offer the key criteria the agent needs to qualify you as a candidate. end with next steps- do you want to schedule a walkthrough, submit an application, have a quick call?  4. make their day. this is a strategy built upon the above principles. you want to close a deal? want to get good service? want a job? don’t make the other party work harder to benefit you. put in the effort to make helping you, easier for them. work with their schedule. be organized. be kind. do not lay your burdens upon them but accept theirs. to the extent you have any agency in the process, this strategy will help you. again loved the post---  i will say though, as for reddit, different subs can feel very different.  i'm part of an incredibly supportive positive sub for caregivers  with 100% no snark or bickering. thanks for the tips. i haven’t had luck yet but it makes sense. i do think it will be helpful. this is a really great response to the age old question of ""why should i have to pay a broker 15%, they don't do anything they just open the door, i found the apartment myself!"".  what they do is deal with the deluge of crap you described. great post.  i vibe with basically everything in here.  i remember seeing that post and glad to have a follow up.  i haven't had to sublet a place i was staying at myself, but someone flaunting wealth up front would be a red flag to me too if i were in that situation.   as far as reddit behavior, it's just the product of person + anonymity + an audience. this is everywhere on the internet.  all you can do after a certain point is be the change you want to see in the world. thank you for the write-up. i'm starting today and dedicating the next couple weeks to apartment hunting and am adjusting my approach immediately. this is very helpful. mixed feelings on this. i totally see where op is coming from bc nobody deserves to be treated that way. op didn't cause this problem and i respect that. but scolding folks who do desperate things in a desperate situation aint sitting right either. our problem is with the system, not w/ each other. everyone have a great day guys every apartment i want to see has a 50-60$ application fee before even seeing the house is this a scam?? great post i went to look at an apartment in a coop a couple years ago, i arrived 10 min early to the open house and there was a line of 20+ people outside the building waiting.  i got inside, looked around, i think i probably took some measurements because i typically do. before i left i made sure to chat with the broker, express my wife and i's interest. i handed him a completed application with all our docs and he let me know he had received a couple offers already that were over asking, and we may need to go over to get accepted.  he also had us write a little intro about ourselves to the owner, that this apartment meant a lot to her and she wanted it in good hands.  in the end, over 100 people saw the apartment in one afternoon, but they only received 6 completed applications. it really was an apartment meant for a couple as it was a 2br where one was much smaller than the other, they also had had problem tenants previously that was a roommate situation and they were trying to avoid that. but apparently a lot of people just showed up without an application and weren't prepared.  we did go over asking, but they ended up choosing us despite the fact that our offer wasn't even the highest. the owner liked that we had cats and was really sold by our intro and our love of the neighborhood.  when i first showed up for that initial tour i thought there was no way, but it worked out, just had to hit the right notes in each step of the process. following you sound like a huge douche. appear eager? don’t flaunt your income? add personalization?  you had someone take over your lease and you’re making it seem like you’ve discovered america all over again.  literally 99.999% of landlords and brokers don’t give a shit about anything you posted apart from “do you make enough money and are you willing to pay the rent/broker fees”?  this is probably one of the douchiest posts i’ve encountered on reddit. how many people with vouchers email you? this is somewhat helpful but i didn’t get any traction until i found a realtor on nextdoor who started showing me listings before they were online. i would put in my messages i have excellent credit, fed contractor for 10+ years, $200k salary, ex army and willing to sign 2 years lease and some of these agents didn’t even respond to emails, text or phone calls. we even put in an application and paid a fee and they never even told us we weren’t approved. excuse my ignorance as i am not from ny but do plan to move there soon. when i go on streeteasy i see hundreds of apartments in and around manhattan available to rent all the time. there seems to be a lot of supply…. so i’m confused when i hear about people fighting over apartments can these people making over 200k just go to jersey and buy a house or something jeez 4.) don’t flaunt your exceptional wealthy  5.) mention how much you make.  …..ok so do you just not like people with good income? what about background and credit checks?  you broke several laws regarding signage and requirements regarding equal housing and credit reporting.",350,116,neutral,0.3917331397533417,466,i would write a note explaining why i wanted to stay in the same place and why i was moving out.i feel like i am being ripped off.i feel like it is a systemic problem.i feel like it is a systemic problem. i have seen it happen. i have seen it happen. i have seen it happen. i am so grateful you wrote thanks! thanks
38,Bidding for Rentals Should not be Allowed,"new york real estate- there are no rules. like checkin at an italian sex party/airport. [deleted] you are preaching to the choir, no one here wants to over bid or get over bidded, it's the nature of the game, there's no price guarantee for street easy and zillow. nothing you say will matter until more housing gets added cause it's an issue of supply and demand. you can't have a case where you the have lowest vacancy rate in history (which we do) and you still want the rest of the apartments available to be cheap. it doesn't work like that, you can nationalize housing and make them all cheap and stablized but then you simply won't ever get an apartment in new york cause they will all be taken already without more housing to supply everyone that wants one.  this isn't an apartment hunting question but more of a political (and philosophical) one because in theory no place is on the scale of new york and has had 100% nationalized housing, and it probably just wont happen. you are trading in allocation of resources from money to being on a system of first come first serve basis, which ""ruins"" the purpose of why people have and make money. i'm not saying that's good or bad just that you have to convince everyone to stop capitalism and especially stop tying in wealth to real estate and property, to nationalize all housing would mean convincing pretty much every american that their house value should no longer go up, good luck with that considering most americans have all of their wealth tied up to their house. and while that might lower the rent, you still have to deal with the fact that everyone wants to live in new york and there is a shortage of units, you either force people to move out, or you allow for laxer zoning. if bidding wasn't allowed people would still do back door deals or just set the initial price way higher.  with that being said, anyone who doesn't get their application approved due to bidding 100% should get a full refund for their application fee. stupidest concept ever. i hear you. i was looking a few years go and the apartment was in my range alcove studio in windsor terrace, it was gorgeous. it was listed at $1300 and i was so excited that i could afford it. then i looked and they said sorry there is a lot of interest and the last person offered like $2300 can you go over that? i was so angry. i was desperate to live alone and it just took me by surprise. its a rental. its happened multiple times since and its disgusting. the most you can be charged to apply for an apartment is $20.  you can avoid the fee if you get a free credit report from the credit reporting firms.  they only time it is more than $20 is if it is a coop or condo sublet.  renting a coop or condo almost guarantees you have to move in around 2 years. listen, it’s real simple. rent regulation and stabilization and all that is not going to fix high costs. it just makes it more expensive. wishful thinking can not change economic reality. the bottom line is nyc needs to change the laws to make it more favorable for developers to buy and build apartments. until that’s done, you’re just going to see things get worse. no matter how good of an idea more socialist housing policies seem, they are not going to work. that’s what got us into this mess. the demand just outstrips supply far too much. the city needs millions more housing units and that’s not going to happen without incentive. you can cry and whine and blame developers and landlords all you want but that doesn’t change reality and it never will. there is tons of research that shows what has to happen to make rents more affordable - more apartments need to be built and that just isn’t going to happen without the possibility for a return on investment. instead of complaining, we need to push hard to get officials in office who make the #1 issue on the table building more housing. till then, prices will keep going up and up and up and up they are running a business. its supply and demand. everyone hates how expensive apartments are, but if you want to fix the issue in new york, everyone who actually knows about the topic (i.e. people researching policies) knows the issue here is not enough construction. you have to incentivize construction. that means fixing zoning, incentivizing developers to build the types of units the market works.  the whole problem in the u.s. since 2008 has been under construction of housing in general. new york is the worst case of it. no its not just your landlord that's causing it. its the also current owners that vote for things that prevent new construction, special interests etc.  no more rent stabilization isn't the solution. rents would be stabilized if construction kept up with demand. however, artificially rent stabilizing prevents construction, because at some point the rent falls below the cost of actually making repairing apartment. they disincentivize construction, because the cost of building/financing a project isn't worth it.  if nyc wants to seriously fix it issues it needs to do the policies that are outlined in reports like this one (rand is a highly respected non-partisan think tank)  see: [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research\_reports/rra2775-1.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rra2775-1.html)  this explicitly looks at nyc and it compares it to a similar size/ density city that has these policies (tokyo) that doesn't have a construction problem. so apartments in nyc should be first come first serve? reward people who get in early and fuck people coming later? just lost an apartment because of this. it was an okay place with a decent price and the owner was gonna put in a dishwasher at the same price… but people bid over asking “as is” without the dishwasher. actual idiots [deleted] i'm sorry and agree with you. the supply and demand may be true but is also problematic. ny, specifically nyc, is amazing but some of the housing laws are terrible. unfortunately, as long as there are participants it will continue. cannot like this post enough. got willed into offering $200 above asking price and idk if there were even other bidders. for all the laws nyc has for real estate, this should be illegal. also, force owners to pay brokers fees. why are tenants required to pay them?!?!? agreed. people need to stop participating in these stupid bidding wars. those of us who grew up here definitely never did that shit and only became a thing post-pandemic when all the transplants came back. to all the people saying this isn’t a communist country / capitalism works, etc., i’m curious - are you also against the $20 cap on application fees? in a purely free market system, the landlord could charge wtv they wanted for application fees and the market would be forced to settle a rate that people would accept. you’d basically need no housing regulation *ever* because free market economics would determine everything. i’m not against lls making a profit, but at the same time, i’m not for a purely unregulated housing market where lls can effectively game market shifts based on what is a fundamental need (as they’ve been doing with warehousing units to artificially create scarcity). housing regulation at least evens the playing field (even if just by a little bit) for a basic human necessity. wait until you find out about the housing market- new yorkers also brought that bidding and offering more than landlords were asking to south florida after covid hit. which drove the prices for apartments and houses through the roof. it sucks and really ruined the market for the locals already living here. a lot of people were forced to leave. not to mention the hedge funds and the large corporations buying up property down here, driving everything up. (it should) why are you paying applications fees? they are illegal i understand the frustration. but i'm sure if you were renting you would do the same. it's all about supply and demand. the highest bidder wins. imagine how those homebuyers felt when rates were low and kept getting outbid by investors and all cash buyers. wasn't a pretty thing. at the sametime token is not always about the highest bidder but more importantly, most qualified ready willing and able buyer/renter. let’s think this through. say you outlaw bidding. 10 people apply at the same asking price. now what?  the leasing agent has to choose 1 applicant and reject the other 9. do you think the chance they decide based on discriminatory factors (age, employment, family status, esa, nationality, etc) is higher or lower than in the case where bidding was allowed? [deleted] so why do you have more of a right than they do? why is it unethical? you both want the same thing and they’re willing to give more for it so they get it, what’s unfair about that? people can do whatever they want. this isn’t communist russia.",351,84,neutral,0.4572231769561767,435,"is not the issue here. the issue is not enough construction. the whole problem in the u.s. since 2008 has been under construction of housing in general. the whole problem in the u.s. since 2008 has been under construction. the whole problem in the u.s. since 2008 has been under construction of housing in general. the whole problem in new york is not under construction. you have to fix zoning, incentivize construction. the"
39,Did i hit the jackpot???,"it's cheaper because you aren't walkable to a subway and deep in queens. all that matters is, it works for you yes. where in queens though? that commute is brutal for most folks i bet there's definitely deals to be had! you just have to be creative in your search and not picky about the areas.   i co-sign about having stellar credit score (800+) and a healthy savings in your bank account to increase your chances of being selected as tenant. if it fits your needs and you love it, then it’s your jackpot. happy for you! depends on where in queens ![gif](giphy|x7woec3echslc) lol at all the bitter people here. hollis literally has an lirr station so this person can get to manhattan nice and fast. congrats on your apartment same! i found a studio for 1440! if you like the area yes, if you wanted to be closer to the city no. queens is generally cheaper. i’ve been looking in queens and have found a lot of studios or 1 bedrooms for $1500 hollis! from kings come queens and queens come kings. run-dmc’s homestead. i’m not mad atcha. ❤️💅🔥 what’s the weekend commute into manhattan like? not really jackpot, but it is good if you like the renovations is there only lirr? i ask due to the lirr monthly being expensive that is definitely a jackpot worthy studio.  did you look on streeteasy? near subway?  sometimes the further from transit the more affordable.  my friend has to take bus to lirr or 7 train.  she pays 1150 for 2 bedroom flushng i'm in rego park off half a dozen bus lines and the r/m train for 1550. doorman building, huge balcony. it's a studio but nearly a 1 bedroom (separate actually useable kitchen, separate dining room, separate changing room in addition to the bathroom, double wide balcony).   i got super lucky but it definitely exists. i used a broker aha paid 1mo broker fee.   just commenting because of folx saying your commute must be a nightmare at this price. that's sometimes the case but i can get pretty much anywhere within about 30min. lower manhattan or brooklyn is closer to 45-60 but i don't really need to go to those areas much if at all . hollis!! jesus what? that’s half way to europe. you’re behind the end of the subway lines. you’d have to pay me 1500 to live there. 2k brokers fee? that is nuts as someone who’s lived in nyc their whole life this is a gem. especially because it is rent stabilized. and hollis is a good neighborhood too. so that’s a plus. this makes me feel like my 1 bedroom 1781/month is cheap. here i was feeling bad about paying 1831 on next lease. i am in brooklyn midwood you went through a real estate company? actually, no queens has extremely affordable apartments and this is very normal for queens. studios here range min 1200 to 2000 being super luxary.. so honestly, you got ripped off paying a broker. one thing i’ll never do is pay a broker if you have to the long island railroad, you’re not in nyc. you’re in li bro not nyc this is making me realize i have a ""jackpot"" apartment. i never thought about it much but rent stabilized, doorman, washer/dryer in building, 1 bedroom, two large walk in closets, two non walk in closets, near the subway and express buses and my rent isn't even 1200. this is depressing because these prices aren't what i'd call a jackpot. hollis and jackpot in the same sentence. interesting 🥹 yea... dont go out after dark in that area.. very ratchet. borderline jamaica.. welcome to the ghetto.                      also keep eyes on your car, lots of car jackings, rims and bumpers being stolen in broad day light. apt warming or nah?  lol. congrats on your new spot. you definitely got lucky. rent in ny is so expensive nowadays. bathroom and kitchen renovated and for that price it definitely sounds like a good deal granted it’s in the other side of queens but still it’s a good deal and can’t forget the laundry either congrats hollis is far and parts of it ain’t that pretty but if you like the apartment sounds like you definitely got something good going for you. i know you mentioned you drive but definitely consider the lirr too; 30 mins to grand central! congrats you got the rent for that price because it’s not the safest neighborhood. be careful walking around at night. one thing people fail to consider is the rent increase once your contract is up, they can increase up to 1000 extra. visit front yard or stoop on a warm saturday night around 11:00 pm.  i’ve been driven out by loud people who congregated in front of my place at night in brooklyn.  they even brought lawn chairs and small tables, thirty feet from my bedroom window. had to move, break lease. where did you find the listing for your new apartment? congrats! live large. you found a gem. not all landlords want to charge the highest price. i live in crown heights and pay $1400 for a one bedroom. the landlady had a terrible tenant and just wants her rent on time with no hassle. what does it look like? $1600 stabilized 1 bedroom on the ues. landlord offered me the apartment because i had preferential rent at my studio and paid early! it happens!!!!! yeah bro no one wants to live in hollis i got a 1br in astoria for 1500 so nah that’s horrible especially in hollis lol jesus christ people are needlessly snarky in this sub towards op. anywhere in new york that isn’t deep upstate or a 260 people town is bound to have a rent price of more than $1500 especially in this economy lmfao.  ignore these weirdos, congratulations, op! jesus do you work at jfk or jamaica hospital or something ? or from home?  pretty residential area and far enough from the city that taking the lirr into manhattan will be faster than the subway but hey maybe that works for ya? good luck :) my dad grew up in hollis hills! 217th st i need help finding an apartment my credit is at 720 look, good for you, but man i feel (honestly and truly) sorry for people getting a studio apartment in hollis (of all places) for $1500 and paying $2000 fees and thinking that's a steal. maybe it is in this world but holy shit. i'm sorry people. america, capitalism, nyc has fucked you.   for context, i lived in upper manhattan 8 years ago with one roommate for $800 per person. our rent went up $50 every two years. 1500 in hollis????? no. everyone who qualifies should try to get middle income housing. i live in a 2 bedroom luxury apartment in geeenpoint with washer dryer in unit, 2 bathrooms, gym in the building courtyard with grill, etc $2400. with a storage unit, bike parking, and car parking my wife and i still pay under 3 grand maybe? depends on if you have crazy noisy neighbors and cheapass landlord who provide almost no heat in the dead of winter 🥶 etc. like my last apartment at about same rent if you're only outside in hollis between 6 am and 4 pm and will shop and spend your time-off in another zip code, yes. [deleted] if you paying a brokers fee, you getting scammed. never pay a brokers fee. i’d be surprised if this isn’t a scam lol i have a renovated studio in a nice neighborhood in chicago for $925 (including all utilities).  and you can't say anything about our crime rates if you live in new york.",348,165,positive,0.7862433791160583,513,i'm in hollis... it's crazy.. rent in nyc is so expensive nowadays.... it's insane.. rent in ny is so.. rent in ny is so expensive nowadays.. rent in ny is so.. rent in ny is so .........

41,New luxury apartment with paper thin walls. What to do?,"i love how these are always sold as luxury buildings when they all are just hideous quick-builds. figure out a way out and only live in a building that’s pre-war when bricks did their job it’s not a “luxury” apartment, is it. sadly, this is how new buildings are made now. you can try sound proofing the walls self-adhesive acoustic panels \[390 lbs/yd³ ultra-high density\], 2nd generation sound absorbing panel,  or place book shelves on shared walls.   you can have management send the tenants a notice to be mindful of noise past a certain hour and in the gym.   good luck. which neighborhood? happened to us. we ended up draining our savings and breaking the lease after 4 months. we literally had noise from 5am to 2am coming from all sides, including a running and screaming toddler overhead who apparently had no bedtime, and we couldn’t get any sleep. we also worked from home and it was unsustainable. you always wanna live in a renovated old building, never a new one. anyway, yeah you gotta get out of there godspeed everyone says to check reviews but please don’t forget to leave reviews so others don’t fall into the same trap you did lmao, these are majority of the luxury buildings in nyc. they are garbage. i currently live in one, and i can hear my neighbor loudly cackling or the door slamming down the hall.   paneling. carpets. an air purifier can all help to drown/muffle out the sound.   it's the price you pay for a nice place in brooklyn. for some reason people think new=luxury. this is absolutely false. stop letting companies trick you into thinking a place is luxury cause it’s got faux marble countertops. new does not equal luxury. these days new means cheap. there is nothing you can do.  just wait for the lease to be over and get out hire a sound consultant to measure the stc and iic sound values. if they are below code requirements, file a complaint with the building department to strong-arm the owner into fixing it or use it as leverage to break your lease. white noise machine new buildings - including ""luxury"" ones - tend to be garbage in this respect. they don't build 'em like they used to, that is for sure! how many floors in the building? the ones that are 5 and under are typically made out of wood & drywall  taller builders required steel & concrete and insulate noise better (at least between floors, not always guaranteed between units) [deleted] the luxury of shitty new construction. it keeps happening because clowns keep paying for it. name and shame the apartment location i think if the loud noises are after 10pm you could call 311 with a noise complaint. have you contacted management? i’d focus on the one neighbor with loud music and the barking dog. let them know in writing that you contacted her face-to-face, she yelled, and now it’s a hostile living situation.    your lease likely specifies either quiet hours or some language about reasonable noise. they might be willing to transfer you to another unit. you have the right to peaceful enjoyment of your apartment. think the city considers that below 30 decibels and  might only cover evening hours. i’d try to measure it and ask for a lease break if those regularly occurring noises can’t be mitigated below by the management company, or if they refuse to try. if you can afford it, https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm5-b?cid=sem-na-3349&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=pmax:+shopping+ads+headphones&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gbraid=0aaaaabidjzhrlsicfbn_5u-dcw88r74ss&gclid=cjwkcajwooq3bhb3eiwayqyoev9fscln0fkj_icwrlfvij1ogzkprkrqsp-suqv25p_u3m1rhkqkhxoc3puqavd_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds    sony wh-1000xm5 or older version wh-1000xm4 saved my life a year ago when i could hear my neighbor sneeze in philly. live in nyc now in a nicer building and can’t hear much, i still use them when the neighbors blast their music or if the ac is too loud! a lot of new buildings are billed as luxury when they really aren't.  they probably cut corners by not insulating party walls (a wall shared between  units). i've seen builders double sheetrock those walls and only insulate outer walls. i might be lucky, but i have lived in 2005 and 2016 buildings in nyc, and no noise problems to speak of. there's a baby who lives immediately next door, and on rare occasions i hear him briefly (currently in 2005 building). you guys need an emergency band meeting xd   you should make a flier   post that you want to meet up to talk in person   like a renters club association xd   host it in your apt, (provide snacks!) ugh that's the worst man, which building/area? prewar is the way to go . massive rooms and thick walls . the heat gets crazy sometimes, but i just crack the windows 😂😂 big enormous luxury buildings are built for extracting as much value as possible for the consumer at the lowest cost. beware! source: loved one works for a big real estate mgmt firm this is unfortunately common in luxury apartments! they are put up so quick, so many corners are cut. pre-war apartments are it! i’ve lived in 2 pre-war buildings and could not hear a thing from my neighbors or the hallway! hopefully it’s a 1 year lease. i live in a pre war building now but before this i could even hear my neighbor talking on the phone, sad part was, he wasn’t even talking loud. new luxury* buildings focus more on services rather than focusing on the actual structure. gym, screen golf, cafe, bar etc but paper thin wall 🥲 a white noise machine and a clock count down the minutes until you can leave. or else you get someone to take over your lease. personally i could not f*cking survive in that environment, no way. i need peace and quiet in this city. a few sirens and some bass blasting, okay i get it. but paper thin walls that are a joke of a separator….no thank you. check your lease buy a large bluetooth speaker and play brown noise on youtube. it blocks out a lot of noise and you don’t notice it move date a screamer lol. sucks to suck loving the pre-war apartment love, did it happily for many years (was also happy to finally move to a building with in-unit w/d and a dishwasher). i think for the most part this advice rings true, though we lucked out and even though our current building definitely cut costs and used aluminum studs in the walls, they must have spent on the solid wood doors, ultra-economic/insulated windows and maybe some new type of drywall, because we’ve been really fortunate about sound. our upstairs neighbors have little kids and we can hear them periodically, but overall it’s pretty solid.   all this to say that your best bet is legit brick masonry, but there are some new-ish construction that works well.   good luck, we all need as much sleep as we can get working like dogs to afford this city. sounds like gentrification karma to me let me and my friends come over and smoke weed at your place for the next week or so. we'll get everyone in line. had this issue with my brownstone. what i did was have insulation pumped into the walls. it’s like a spray foam. they drill a hole and pump it in then seal it. i didn’t get anymore tenants complaints after that. for reference, the complaints were loud tv’s, voices and music. after this installation sound was greatly minimized. porn playlist playing extra loud for whenever you're out.   the building will find a way to start enforcing some noise controls. move. if you can afford luxury, you can afford peace. ah yes the luxury apartments of america, tbh i’ve always terminated a lease early when it was a place with thin walls or loud ass hallways. good luck friend! this is why we need to be saving our older buildings and not knocking them down to build crap in their place. some basic suggestions- noise may be coming in under your front door - if so get a good sweep or even better they sell door seals that come down when you close the door - i recently bought new solid doors for my condo bedroom doors and has door seals built in for an extra $75 each.  i added seals to the outside of my front door to stop sound from coming in or escaping.    also mid and high frequency sound can travel through the holes in the walls, which are generally ac outlets .  there are foam inserts behind the switch plates that can help, but better if both apartments (meaning you and your neighbor) put the foam inserts behind the switch plates and outlet plates - use two each.  basically anyplace a draft can enter, so does sound.  if you want to see if your front door leaks, turn off the lights and have someone shine a light outside your door. unless the building doesn’t advertise sound proof, don’t rent or buy. we made sure our new construction apartment was sound proof before living in it, we in mott haven and these new luxury constructions really mean what they say. a while back lived in lic and the new construction buildings we stayed in were trash. this is exactly what i’d expect from new construction  🤷🏻‍♂️ i mean you have to move luxury is just branding in nyc prewar bricks = soundproofing luxury filing a complaint with 311 is hit/miss but worth trying. you can report excessive barking or loud noise late into the night, and i think they try to send someone to investigate though majority of the time, by the time someone comes the noise is over. one time it worked for me and they asked the neighbor to turn down their music. though the neighbor resumed playing some weeks later so ymmv. a dog barking that often and that frequently will cause the city to fine the owners if you file a 311 complaint. if it persists, the city will require the owners to remediate the situation (training, insulation, a different room) or they will lose the dog. the dog is in distress and it is cruelty. you just have to call and follow up and call some more, have the times it barks etc. an inspector will come to listen for it and to measure the volume. it’ll take some time, maybe even months, but the problem will be fixed. my super once got a pitbull puppy who cried all day bc he was neglecting it for hours at a time and it was also stinking up the building. someone called the aspca or some similar organization and the dog got taken from him. he later got evicted once he got fired and stopped paying rent. luxury has zero to do with construction and everything to do with amenities and service level i.e  doorman or not. ""luxury"" that’s what you get for getting an over priced market inflating “luxury” apartment ruining the city tbh. my advice would be move back to the midwest i see a lot of discussion about construction on this thread, but getting back to your issue i think your options are to either move, or attempt some kind of renter friendly soundproofing. you might spend a lot of money on that and it might not work. can you ask the landlord if you can switch to another apartment in the building ? maybe there is an available unit further from the gym and that awful neighbor. there are lots of decorative wall panels that are sound proof. dm if you need help. it’s not a “luxury” apartment, then maybe the building wasn't built right because codes should prevent this type of acoustics fire with fire get a more obnoxious speaker get ear protection for yourself and commit to not letting them sleep ( get a whistle for the the dog so she can’t sleep with dog barks ) purchase a boat horn that you get in a can. be the controller of your own domain and train the puppies as they need be. move to the ghetto.  luxury apartments are overrated and you are spending way too much to be living like this.  oh shit, but in the ghetto aren't you gonna have the same issues!?  god bless america. do you also have misophonia? lol. i’ll never live in a luxury building again bc of these reasons. i had all of the same complaints w my building and never had any luck trying to address any of them. tough shit playboy. find a better apartment lol i have empathy for you. can you look into white noise for your bedroom while you sleep? also, try exploring on amazon apt noise blockers (things to seal/soundproof your door from the inside etc).   not sure how long ""just moved into"" refers to, but try to focus on the excitement you had that drew you to this luxury building in the first place, and really embrace that! does your bldg have a cool roof-deck that you can see sunrise/sunsets from, and you can host friends? take advantage of that in-house gym (that beats my $375 pilates reformer monthly membership that i get on the subway for, lol).  i live in a gut-renovated brownstone walkup. last year a new neighbor moved in with 2 dogs who howled if i moved around barefoot in my apt during my wfh days, making work calls insane. the dogs did the same throughout each weekend for 1 month. i generously thought these dogs needed to adjust to living in a new building and environment.   one day these dogs were howling at 5am on a saturday. non stop, lol. and then i said no more. i grabbed a marker and wrote a clear letter to this neighbor about what i and others in the building were enduring for over 4 weeks now. i time stamped my note and signed it a sleep deprived neighbor.  then i pasted  note to the front entrance of our building so that the neighbor, and anyone else in our brownstone would see that note written in big marker font at 5:15am. later that afternoon, i noticed the note was gone. and the dogs never made a howling sound again. and yes, that neighbor still lives in the building, with somehow quieter dogs who i hear only occasionally, but i see them out the window...   you can try this (paste the note in your elevators or by the elevator button on your floor and sign it ""sleep deprived neighbor"". if the dog continues barking for another week, record it barking at a crazy hour and share that with the super/mgmt team.  hope this helps a bit - good luck!",346,163,negative,0.6892862319946289,509,sqqqqss i’m so sorry to hear that you broke your lease after 4 months. i’d try to find a new apartment and get out of there. what neighborhood? are. new are new means cheap. this is how new buildings are made now. garbage.. are.. new does not equal luxury. new or. call.
42,Is $3k in rent too much for a $100k salary?,"you and your other roommate should get a new place together. the ues has studios in the low 2k range. they’re not luxurious but you can always pay for an equinox membership and still pay less than $2.5k total. yes. your after tax pay will only be around 70k assuming 30% taxes. that’s around 5,833 per month. 3,000 now is going toward rent. that only leaves you with 2,833 a month. after utilities, groceries, phone and internet bills, healthcare, 401k, subscriptions, necessities, you’ve barely got anything left to spend on yourself let alone save.  also you probably won’t even get approved for an apartment that expensive in nyc, landlords usually require you to make 40x the rent, and that’s a minimum limit, most people feel comfortable spending much less than that on rent. r/circlejerknyc that's 50% at least of your take home pay. pass! why aren’t you open to other areas? would you rather waste your money and live on the edge than commuting for an extra 15min? thought this was a circlejerk post for a hot minute yes, it’s too much. i make more than you and i wouldn’t pay that much lol. if you’re looking in ues you should be able to find a studio for way less, although it will surely be less “nice”. you really shouldn’t spent more than 30% of your pre-tax income on rent.   you’re at 36%. i’m guessing after tax your monthly payment is around 5k. so more than half of your monthly income is on rent.   yes, it’s too expensive for you. your absolute maximum budget for rent is 2500.  eta: you don’t make 40x the rent. you won’t be approved without a guarantor.  eta2: a lot of people saying this is “outdated”.   can you pay way more and be okay? sure. but if you want to go out once or twice a week, be able to fund a hobby, want to save for a vacation, want to save up for retirement, or *you need to financially support another person/family*, it’s a good number to stick to.   your finances are finite. if you spend more on rent, you must spend less on something else. people here talking like it’s normal in nyc to be spending less than 30% of your check on rent lol. i make ~$95k and spend $2.2k on rent. it’s definitely a stretch. [deleted] unfortunately just gonna have to find new roommates. i know people making double who are still wary of 3k for rent it depends on you. i know this will get downvoted by the ridiculous people in this sub, but i lived for a decade spending over 50% of my income on rent and i was fine. if you’re happy in your place and you’re making do with what’s left over after paying rent then good for you. that really depends on how much you need after paying rent my guy. people get by with all sorts of situations that are far more precarious. example: being in heavy debt or having dependents while also having a lower salary. of course, it may come at the cost of having less savings than economists recommend but like…its your life and life is not an excel spreadsheet or recommended formula. yes. when i made 100k there’s no way i could afford that, i paid closer to 1600 (with a roommate) and could probably afford 2k if i didn’t have any student loans and maybe 2500 if i was more disciplined with other spending like eating out, shopping, traveling, etc. but i don’t think that would be worth it. you also need to factor in retirement investments, savings, etc that takes a chunk out of your paycheck. the equation we use in manhattan is 40 x rent . should be your salary.  3k x 40= 120k. you should be able to find a studio in the 2k range in the ues but you're going to have to be okay with buildings that aren't as nice/less updated as you'd find in gramercy. yes 3k is a lot. ny taxes are insane and the job market isn’t especially safe right now. you don’t wanna be unemployed with a 3k apartment. last march nyc had 250k evictions on the docket. you don’t want to be one of them. no, you can’t afford it.  my friend your age also makes $100k, pays less than $3k, and struggles every month, barely going out or buying anything for herself and certainly not saving. i’m sorry your going through that. it is a lot of rent for your salary. i would open up your range so you can find things below this range ultimately it may require more from you but will at least help your mental health yes. though, look: i’ve lived here for a long time, and most people i know, about half their income goes to rent. it’s just the nature of the beast for most. check out listingsproject and leasebreak (roommate and full apt options).  there are lots of people still paying rent prices similar to 2020, so you can save a fair bit by renting from them directly and not confining your search to new listings can't you and your roommate ask the one who is causing to move out citing all the issues? i am not familiar with renting laws but there should be something where you can complain to landlord about certain behaviour from the roomate. go for 2500 i would base it on your bring home then see if you can handle the rest of the standard bills; food, lights, water, heat, gas, etc. at $100k i’d say your bring home is around $5300/month. sounds a little tight to me. all it takes is one major expense and your whole payment setup per month will take 6 months or more to get settled back into the norm. assuming you're in your prime fun years i would highly suggest taking a look at brooklyn, east village, lower east side, upper westside near columbia university. .  you can find a cozy place on a charming tree lined street with boutiques, bars and bakeries for something between 2,500-3k. look harder for something older and smaller and you might get something for 2200.  these spots will be more suited towards younger people, better dating pools, venues etc. . .i work in chelsea and hang around  gramercy sometimes and i'm not sure i'd like to be within the crossroads of flatiron, chelsea and madison. . . .you get either vapid tourists or geriatrics or people like your roommate. your peace is worth it depends on what your parents are willing to contribute to your budget honestly yeah it is. i make 120k and am uncomfortable with spending more than ~2200 max in rent. i live in a 1bd in harlem for less than 2100 with all utilities included, so finding a place on your own is definitely possible, but 3k would basically mean that after food, utilities, household stuff you would have nothing left over to save. personally i live in a small rent stabilized 1br in the ues for $1900 making 105k and i find it a bit rough... if i had to pay an extra thousand a month i wouldn't know what to do with myself. its maybe possible if you basically never do anything but imo its not worth paying so much to live in a good location if you're not actually going to be able to go out and do stuff in the location can attest - i pay myself 100k salary through my own company.  after rent, utilities, insurance, living expenses, it's incredibly tight.  my rent is $2,500 + utilities, ends up being around $2,800 per month. do you not have other bills or savings to contribute to? i make $130k and would never pay $3k on my own. just because you have a shitty roommate in a 2k room, it doesn't mean your next step should be a 3k apt. there's a ton of 2k rooms in the city, it's not a unique deal. you know, you can find okay places for 2k-ish outside of manhattan. my partner pays about 2300 a month for their place in flatbush that is a pretty big 1 bedroom…big enough for a king sized bed, dressers, and a desk with plenty of space around them. it isn’t a fancy building with tons of amenities or anything, but i pay substantially more for my apartment in manhattan that is pretty comparable in size. yea. i would look for places around 2k-2500 max i feel like only you can determine this because we don’t know your other bills, spending habits, or if you have someone that helps you financially from time to time. you can do it if you know how to manage your money well. when my rent went above 3k, i left nyc and bought a house in nj. welcome to new york it’s been waiting for you! get outta manhattan. you could find a decent place in queens or brooklyn for under 3k. i lived in the first floor of a house it was a 1br in astoria paid 1.8k and i was 3 stops away from grand central, had a backyard, laundry in unit, and big open kitchen.  i now live in a nice building, with doorman and laundry in astoria paying 2.7k. i just checked streeteasy the other day, there were some 1b1b apartments on the uws for < 3000 (with broker's fee tho)   &#x200b;  with your take home pay, i would look for apt with max budget of 2500. of course you can manage that on your current salary if you want to. but my other question would be - what if you get laid off or have an unexpected expense? damn 100k and 3k rent with roommates… glad i left nyc… had roommates before and hated it… with that salary you could really do some solid investments and other things.  do you have to live in nyc? can you commute from someplace less expensive? you make $100k, of course you can afford to live alone. i’m a freelance musician and if my friends can do it then i think you’ll be okay. maybe look somewhere other than lower manhattan … go to brooklyn. avoid williamsburg (way overpriced) and you’ll find a really great place. for me the most fun is finding the needle in the haystack. yes it will feel very painful unless you have another income source or parents that are giving you money [deleted] [deleted] yes google the 40x rule (i’d be surprised if you haven’t heard of it, but it happens)  the max you’d typically be able to apply for on your own would be $2.5k on a 100k salary. so the quick answer is “no”. if you get a guarantor then you could probably do it, but i’d advise against it, you’re already going to be spending a large sum of your income at 2.5k, so unless you enjoy cooking and staying in a lot i’d recommend keeping your max budget at $2.5k.  that being said, there should be plenty of studios and even 1br’s in manhattan at or under $2.5k. if you want more space, there’s also bk and queens across the river  edit: sorry but judging by [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nycapartments/s/z5honpj0oz) you need to learn how to budget properly and save money. your ideal lifestyle is just not sustainable long term. expand your neighborhood options. no need to pay rent with a 2 in front of it with or without roommates you have to take your other monthly expenses into account. reconsider living outside of ues/fidi or whatever trendy neighborhood, especially if you wfh. there are plenty of great affordable apartments in brooklyn and queens in relatively safe and beautiful neighborhoods. yes, it’s too much.  rent a room in an apartment instead. it is too much but you should still do just for the increase in peace of mind and happiness. life is short. personally i think it’s too much - i make the same salary and never paid more than $2,100 per month in rent, and i lived in a studio on the ues. if you downsize or move somewhere cheaper you can definitely get a cheaper place and not need to worry about roommates   over half your salary going to rent is really hard to make work. i would aim to spend $2,500 or less yeah $3k is way too much. i pay $2k for a one bedroom making $85k and i’m struggling to pay rents, have fun, pay off loans, and meet my savings goals. i’ve come to a harsh realization that if i want to live alone, i have to cut back on other fun spending as well as so some extra side work for more money. i would look for an apartment $2500 or less and give up some amenities. i am just a lurker i own a home but i’m just curious why you don’t look at an apartment by yourself for 2300? you may be able to find a studio or even a one bedroom to qualify you'd need a combined household of income $120k or significant assets and an amazing credit score or a guarantor. yes most management companies won’t approve you unless the rent is 40x your gross income. some ask as high as 47x.  assume 40x, so $3k would be $120k per year salary requirement. most jobs will write a letter though saying you make whatever you need to qualify… we make the same amount. 3k is absolutely way too much, you probably take home around ~4500 depending on your 401k contributions and other health benefits (i’m assuming), that leaves you with ~1200 for the month you’re gonna be stretched very thin. i would consider either moving elsewhere with a different roommate or maybe moving to one of the outer boroughs if you want to live alone and find a cheaper rent. people here are really bad at budget i guess but it is easily possible. don’t listen to them! you’re gonna have to be ok with moving to less trendy neighborhoods and spending more time on your commute. i have made this compromise for years (affordable rent, live alone, but commute from south brooklyn) so the tradeoffs can suck, but it’s better to have a place to yourself you can go home to and  not deal with this drama. and maybe fall in love with another part of ny while you’re at it. ffs yes you can find a studio in ues for under $3k if you're okay with an older building and no amenities. if you can adjust your standards for your sanity, i'd recommend looking between $2400-$2700 and being open to a studio.   when i was unemployed, my boyfriend was paying $2600 for our place on a 90k salary. definitely doable, but $3k would have sent him overboard. good luck move to more affordable area yes absolutely unless the apartment includes absolutely everything, you don't have serious medical problems and you don't have kids/a spouse that doesn't work, it would be fine.  but if you're anything like me, not a great idea.  my husband has a salary of 110k give or take with bonuses, etc.  we found, after doing the math, it would be incredibly risky for us to pay more than 1700 (no ultilies included).  with crazy high ultilities, parking fees, other bills, food, car maintenance, vet/food for our 2 kitties, savings and the insane medical bills i have, if we paid more than 1700 we'd have absolutely no way to save and live comfortably with the occasional vacation or have enough to set aside a little fun money.  it's also cutting way too close that if the rent were raised, we'd be on the street.  always leave a buffer. it better not be cus that’s basically what i’m paying on way less it’s fine this is normal in big cities. high cost of living cities the 30% rule doesn’t apply. it’s often more. try to find an apartment for $1500 insane! i earn $100k and my rent is $1750 i live in yonkers so i’m close to the metro north to get to manhattan when i want. please don’t throw away so much of your hard earned income to rent 😭 you’re in luck! there are a ton of nice 1 bedrooms on the ues in the $2300-$2600 range. be patient and find something you’re happy with, $3k is a bit much. i saw a youtube video years ago where people who work in tokyo could afford to buy a house 45 min away for $80k. that’s a bullet train though so it could be far away but you still get to work on time and save money and own your own home at the same time. new york city has to come up with a similar solution or it will continue to lose residents. 500k is a lot as reported by the nytimes since 2020–https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/nyregion/nyc-population-decline.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringsource=articleshare yes yes for real?? no! 100 k?  you can afford it p😔😔 it is for me and i make more than 100k in nyc. i refuse to pay that and i have a pretty big place in manhattan. i don’t think it’s logical for me. with roommates that crazy, your quality of life would still be far better in your own apartment without the doorman, laundry, elevator, or separate bedroom. shoot for $2500, studios are def available at that price on the ues east of 3rd av. yes and you wouldn’t even qualify. i make more than $100k and wouldn’t spend $3k on rent move to long beach fugg it in short yes. i did it for a year and it was doable. i couldn’t save much month to month but was able to save my full yearly bonus. if you aren’t in a job were you get a substantial bonus (+$10k) i wouldn’t do it. savings are important. maybe move in with your other roommate ? yeah - it’s too much. that being said - sounds like your situation is a bit desperate.   up to you to weigh exactly how desperate you are to get out of there, but agree with others that you could be in a different neighborhood for less than 3k. 100k is not nearly even close enough for me to feel comfortable to pay for a 3k rent (i’d cap at 2k tbh.)  i’ve lived in nyc for more than a decade and made everything from 50k to over 4 times that, trust me. you don’t wanna be spending that much of your paycheck on rent. 3k is too much, but if your goal is to live alone and you’re willing to compromise on other things (doorman, elevator building, etc.), you can get a studio or 1 bedroom for less than $2500 pretty easily, particularly in ues. yes yes you’d comfortably qualify for a $2.5k apt. 2,500x40=100k  if you gave a guarantor and are looking for a 3k apt, they’d need to make 240k 3,000x80=240k your tax deductible should be $36k right from the start. people like op make it hard for the rest of us in the renting market. he barely makes enough and will fight tooth and nail to assure reddit he can afford it even though he asked for advice. property owners love him! since you likely won't have a car payment, you can make it work.   you'll have around $5000 after all the taxes and shit  but do you absolutely have to live in manhattan? look at nyc housing connect. with that income you can find a lux building around 2000 the ami in some places goes to 150 salary - affordable housing just because you can doesn’t mean you should yes! lol i used to pay $3k when i made 50k a year. i moved to a lower rent place and then the metro line got worked on and so i’d have to wake up at 5 am to the office at 9 am and i’d get home at 10pm and this lasted for months. decided moving closer to the city was worth the price of not spending 8 hours commuting daily.   thankfully all of that is behind me and that type of living situation was temporary. i make ~$100k and would definitely not want to spend $3k a month on rent no no if you have roommate(s) 3k rent lol. why would anyone want to live in a shithole like ny paying that much..? if you are single, and your base is 100k, $3k/month is max and you can live decently, not baller obviously.   your monthly net paycheck is $5k, which assumes putting away 10% in 401k and paying for healthcare. you can even prob save $5k-7k/year too...  so your net spend is $2k/month (not including living exp like food/cell/internet/electricity) but that gives you maybe $1200/month to spend freely...its not too bad. if you even have to ask this, i don’t think you’d be able to swing this “tight” budget. you obviously spend wildly irresponsibly. find a cheaper place. you don’t need to live in gramercy. yes. but whose name is on the lease? if it’s yours or the “good” roommate, can you kick the other one out? yes. you need to keep it to 2 or so. get roommates or make more money. as a residential re agent. the rule of thumb is if you make 40x the monthly rent you can afford it i make about triple that and my mortgage is under $3k. you can survive with $3k rent but you won’t be able to aggressively save for retirement / a house / etc. i’d try to live below your means and work towards future financial goals just move to queens, its better anyways. i think you can make it work if you value your own place that highly. it just depends on the rest of your spending which nobody but you knows. i've lived with 100k a year and 2k rent and it sucked to consistently spend that plus other bills, including a car.  3k is only sustainable at that income if you don't do anything or spend on anything else. omg i have been in your situation before and ended up having to get an order of protection against that crazy roommate. turns out she had borderline personality disorder. yes, you can afford 3,000 rent on your salary! act fast, these situations escalate quickly. stay safe! you would need to make 40x the rent… $3k is $120k. you wouldn’t qualify. consider new rochelle not really. in some ways it’s almost too inexpensive. i say go for it. don’t think twice. op, sent you pm",346,366,neutral,0.4729064702987671,712,"nyc is insanely expensive and the job market isn’t especially safe right now.victions. i’m sure you’re not. i’m making $100k and paying $2k rent.victions.victions. i’m making $100k and paying $3,000. so 3,000 of your income is going toward rent.victions. make and"
43,Why do apartment buildings have windows in the showers?,"so the shower plants can get sunlight. i think there’s a law that if there is a window that opens, then you don’t need to put in a vent system in the bathroom, so it may make apartment construction easier/cheaper not sure about this particular apartment but some converted buildings simply had no option but to leave the window in versus closing it up you can get a curtain or simply replace the glass with frosted glass some people would pay extra for this because living in an nyc high-rise is a dick-measuring contest. window makes it easier to compare. we're all voyeurs. there's a certain level of idgaf the higher you go in the building, binoculars be damned. i've just come to accept that people may get a free show when i need to bathe. but instead of making an opaque covering i just use the steam to write “buy me dinner first” some people r confident with their bodies shrugs so that they can rent the shower out as a second bedroom. guess i’m an exhibitionist cuz i wouldn’t mind that window 🙃 because i love showing off my big golden brown yams to the world!!! muahahahaha my bathroom has a window (in the shower kinda like this pic) and i love it. being able to open a window to air out the bathroom is clutch when it’s a small apartment space cause that building was probably built before showers existed lol i like a windows in the shower some buildings have showers in the window. the exterior came first. i used to have a window in my old apartment. it was great to shower during the daylight. worth it. if you're nervous about people peeking in ,get one of those window provacy films i love that i can air out the bathroom and get sunlight for my plants.  but for the love of god, why is there no privacy glass? i used to live there (it's called the gilroy)....usually had the blinds down but it is quite the luxury to just shower with windows up most of the time in cities or metropolitan areas. the way these buildings come into existence is first they need the funding and they do so by creating renderings of what it could look like so they can show to investor and see how pretty it would look. typically an envelope designer or architect focusing on the facade will draw these and most of the time it will b symmetrical... at this phase they mayne have no idea what the interior will look like and after they get approval they will fit in however they can.  in order words. first they draw the box on the outside and then pack the box with whatever they have to. it’s all about showing off, like renting one of those apartments in the first place because then you can show off. same reason for floor to ceiling windows lol you can place a glass sticker on it. it still lets light though, but works like stained glass or frosted glass. it’s very inexpensive and works great! do you want black mildew in your bathtub's wall and edges? cause not having a shower window is how you get black mildew and mold like build up in your bathtub walls and edges.   also, you're a grown fucking person who can afford nyc rent. trust me, no one gives a fuck about you being naked. and if you truly believe people are actively looking at others shower, grow up. fire hazard i thought it was a new york thing that no one dare who’s watching and / or no one cares and not watching so it doesn’t matter you can just get those frosted waterproof stickers so the light still comes thru but no one can see you nakey so you can let all the steam and humidity out bc they don't have exhaust fans. anything weird in nyc apartments is usually explained by it originally having been designed with a completely different layout. you get things like 2 bedrooms where you have to walk through the master bedroom to get to the second bedroom, or kitchens in the corridor. natural light i would love this, actually. all that light in the shower? yes, please. i want them to see. because it’s awesome. if somebody’s looking in my window it’s their problem not mine. so we can see derek jeter when he poops. i love having one in our shower. obviously blind down when showering but opening the window after the shower let's the humidity out. i also hang dry my clothes often on the shower curtain and opening the window dries em up quick because ventilation and light. tbh i like windows in every room (yes point access blocks). i guess some blinds would be enough for privacy i love those looks great. letting light in those tiny dark apartments so you can spank it while staring at the neighbors so it’s a legal kitchen in case you decide to jump mid shower . i would actually love to shower with a view why not? for sex i have in my house, and if you have privacy not gonna lie i really like it. it’s also possible they have privacy film on the window i've never seen a nyc apartment with a window in either the bathroom or the kitchen. i seriously doubt this is the norm. i would love it though, then i could have plants in there! there is usually a shade. the apartment next to my office has them. but one apartment likes to leave it open i wish i had a bathroom window ! why not have a view as you shower?  having a window in a shower in a high rise is actually a crazy cool luxury….. not much says “i’ve made it” like showering as you look out over the entire city people just put a curtain up amazon has this cool film that would give privacy and when the light hits you’ll have rainbows all over the bathroom to press pickle for the exhibitionist in you! just get frosted window film , clean the glass and apply.  home depot, or even etsy sells it.   they won’t see you. i have a window in my shower but it’s frosted glass. i haven’t seen a window in a shower not frosted before till this pic tbh. because it’s advertised as an amenity for the building across the way - free peep show. it’s so you can compare buttholes with the guy across from you. it's for daylighting (green design thing). the window gives the room access to natural light during the day, lessening the need for electricity/artificial lighting. community engagement. duh for people to see you naked it is for ventilation since if a bathroom doesn't release moisture then the mildew can for into black mold which isn't good for your lungs natural light is a luxury in nyc i had to do this to my apartment in dallas. i went on amazon and got this [https://www.amazon.com/privacy-stained-reusable-removable-decorative/dp/b08n44nl3s/ref=sr\_1\_18?crid=dev6qu7k8to&keywords=frosted+glass+window+film&qid=1706105959&sprefix=frosted+%2caps%2c121&sr=8-18](https://www.amazon.com/privacy-stained-reusable-removable-decorative/dp/b08n44nl3s/ref=sr_1_18?crid=dev6qu7k8to&keywords=frosted+glass+window+film&qid=1706105959&sprefix=frosted+%2caps%2c121&sr=8-18)  &#x200b;  but there are a ton of options. you cannot see through it and it has a rainbow color shine through it. $9 for a roll, i would possibly get 3 or 4 rolls to make sure every inch is covered.",336,123,positive,0.7985418438911438,459,i love having a window in my shower. it lets the humidity out and lets the light in. the window. there. i love having a window in my shower. it lets the humidity out and lets the light in. windows. i love having one in my shower. i love that it lets the light in. i love that it lets the humidity out. windows make it easier to compare. and. i
44,Check if your building is rent stabilized!,"dude sue them and get your rent dropped you should definitely get back what you overpaid!! landlord know full well what they were doing, and they should not be able to get away with it. buildings aren't rent stabilized, apartments are (although all of the units in a building *may* be rent stabilized). you definitely need to submit a dhcr overcharge complaint what's the legal rent on the apartment? um, landlord is still making out with a ton of cash. he should be paying you back rent. it’s also likely that $2,950 numbers is already inflated. i’d recommend filing an overcharge complaint or working out a much better deal with your ll the cognitive dissonance required to think it’s ok to subsidize your landlord for 9 years please do new yorkers a favor and sue them, this is the only way that everyone needs to act on asap omg! i also live in chinatown and moved in during the pandemic. i requested the information about my apartment about an hour ago, so it is nuts to see this on my feed. how long did it take to get the results by mail? i thought you were gonna end this post by saying your landlord agreed to lower it back to the rent stabilized rate. you're still pay 3gs?? girl sue them anyway. buildings aren't stabilized,  individual units are. i am a rent stabilized tenant. i requested the rent history form and my apartment rent was raised 1000 dollars in 2006. does anyone know how to check if this was legal? you should at least tell the landlord you plan to sue him because there’s a chance he’ll just want to pay the backpay himself. friend was subletting from someone who overcharged this way and they just gave him three years worth of backpay rather than deal with legal fees (they know they’d lose!) and punitive fees on top of the actual backpay itself. sue them you can also call 311 and ask for the tenant helpline, and someone will walk you through your options. they can even sometimes help you decode your rent history. ive never had nor met one landlord that wasnt a scumbag good for you for sticking up for yourself. it sounds like you possibly have a case for a much further rent reduction, repayment of overcharged rent, and treble damages. it was probably destabilized when you rented. on what basis did your data say it was stabilized, and what renovations were performed after the last tenant? thank you! i did the thing where i requested my rental history, and i got it in the mail, but then for the last 10 years there was no price and it was something like “not eligible” or “doesn’t qualify” i forget the exact words. anyone else experience this? i’ll drop this here:https://www.publicnow.com/view/1dffb1e892ecf20a081d0fb39ec3be66107c6dad i’m thinking of doing the same thing. but my lease is up very soon. how long did it take for your landlord to get back to you? poor ppl behavior it’s so immoral. i can’t believe it.  you want to pay below the market…and also sue the landlord?   you are legally allowed to steal and you are wanting even more.",330,75,negative,0.523408830165863,405,? how long did it take for your landlord to get back to you? sue them. you are illegally allowed to steal and you are wanting even more. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them. sue them.
45,RENTING SUCKS,"i hear you, it’s extremely hard.  i haven’t hit the 100k mark yet, but i’m close, and i rent on the ues.  loft studio.  me and my cat.  it’s a trade off- i knew that my quality of life would be better without roommates because i’m a total hermit.  my priorities are my cat, my job, my peace of mind, and my location.  here, i get those things but it means sacrificing just about everything else.  i’m not going to lie, it’s not easy, and there have been months i’ve been late with the rent this year.  that’s never happened to me before.  the rent has been jacked so high since i moved here that i’m sort of in a shitty spot: not enough income to move, not enough income to stay.  i think i could try to pare down my other expenses- streaming services, maybe, or take on another job outside my career.  but it’s hard to keep chipping away at what you have.  i’ve already lost 38 lbs since the last rent hike.  there’s no diet quite as effective as not being able to afford much more than rice, cereal, and canned veggies.  😞 at least my cat gets the premium shit.  that’s a non-negotiable. 100% in the same boat. thought i had a good apartment on lock, then they rented it out to someone willing to move in 5 days before me. shits ridiculous. i’m so confused as to why you need to rent a 2 bedroom to live on your own. you know where you live, right?  as far as owning goes, you can buy an hdfc coop. there are bargains out there. a friend of mine has a 1 bedroom in harlem on the top floor and the roof is all hers. she makes much less money than you do.   the only problem with an hdfc is that they have income caps to buy, so when you sell, you won’t be able to sell for millions.   you can buy market rate coops in every borough, but in manhattan you’d be looking at washington heights and inwood.   if you want a house, look in the bronx. everything else costs too much for you right now. yeah i think our generation won't be able to afford a home. idek how much they will charge for interest for a first time homeowner. i live in southern brooklyn and am doing fine. found a 2bdr gem for under 2k for a small landlord. it’s doable in the outer parts of the borough, but i agree it shouldn’t be so difficult and you shouldn’t have to give up so much to find decent housing in nyc. 1) i found a sub $2k 1br in a good and convenient (but not perfect) neighborhood. ask your network. post and search on socials, get zillow email notifications, make friends with realtors. sucks but these are where most of the non-insane rents are.  2) join someone in a luxury 2br/2ba. there are apartment layouts where you will barely see one another. a friend of mine has his own entrance.  3) compromise. you have to write out everything you are looking for and sort it into priorities. what amenities are you willing to lose to lower your rent? are there services that could replace an in unit w/d like wash & fold? you don’t have unlimited money so decide on what you will and won’t pay for.  4) compare = despair. who gives a fuck what your coworkers are doing or who got lucky and bought early thanks to a friend of a whatever? everyone in this city is doing what they can with what they got. be proud that you are living and working and making it here. nyc is a global dream and you are living it. my buddy cries at 600k/yr.  i wont be able to travel as much.  bitch, i make 30k and make it work.  make it work.  shut up. 115k in this city really isn’t that much. you haven’t “made it”. you need to be making more like 160+ and have a so also making 130k+. also, probably not going to find a 1 bed for 2k. unless you’re farther outside manhattan and the “hip zones”.   it’s tough. if you allocate more of your take home towards rent, then you don’t have much to spend on going out and enjoying the city that you so desperately want to live in. or you can sacrifice your future by putting less into your 401k. might be worth it if you’re still looking for mr or mrs right. hard to be in the dating pool when you have to commute to the pool.   it’s not easy. good luck. i think there somewhere along here where you have to accept that you can’t have it all. sounds like you want to max out your 401k, live on your own, live in a good neighborhood, have a social life and save for a house. at 120k you can comfortably do 3 of those things if you give up the others. idk man i’m in the same boat as you and i’m very happy. owning property is overrated. ppl say when you rent you throw money away but when you own, you pay property taxes, closing costs when you buy and again when you sell, and spend a ton on repairs over the years.   meanwhile you’re stressing over money the whole time bc you put your whole life savings into making the down payment.   the house goes up in value but it will never go up the level it did for the the generation before us. back then people’s salaries went up a lot more regularly. now our economy continues to grow bc ppl take on credit card debt and home equity loans. if folks are already stretched thin, who are these ppl in 20 years who are going to buy your house for 10x what you paid?  value will still rise but not as much and inflation will eat into that. so that plus all the costs of owning, i don’t think it’s so great.   renting for 2k, paying no taxes, no repair cost/responsibility, and moving on hassle free whenever you feel like it, not to mention having a lot of money in the bank bc you didn’t sink your life savings into a down payment? i don’t think that’s a bad thing at all. i make about the same and have my own one bed in the ues. but i dont have a 401k or have to pay for my insurance. my rent is about 3000 and its works. i think its a give and take. no pension but i dont have to live with roommates and even if you buy a house , incase you want a family in the future  you need to be able to afford child care and have good public schools around i'm in the process of buying now.  the first step is to save.  you have to be mindful, budget heavily, and live modestly for a few years until you have a solid savings of ideally like $100k.    the next step is to get into a long term relationship.  i know it shouldn't be a requirement, but it's twice as easy with a second income and a second savings.  finally, once you have a solid savings for like 50% down, buy an apartment.  don't go crazy and look into midtown or anything.  but if you can put $200k down between the two of you, and you buy a modest 1-2bd coop for $450k, your mortgage payment is going to be less than rent.  even with interest rates where they are now, you're looking at around $2500/month all included (mortgage, taxes, hoa, insurance, most utilities).  the more money you put down, the lower the monthly ""rent"".  i'm under 30 and about to own a two bedroom apartment by using these steps.  otherwise do what a lot of late millennials are doing and buy an investment property outside of the city in some vacation area.  rent it out to cover most of the mortgage and upkeep, and you can even stay there weeks out of the year for free.  then keep renting in the city.  you scratch your 'own a home' itch, and you also have more money to rent a nice place. if you pull in $2,500 per check, what expenses do you have outside of rent?  imo if you’re netting $5k a month, $2-2.5k for rent is an acceptable premium to live alone in nyc dumbest post in the world, there are people who make far below that who are living fine. if you’re tryna rent in the upper east’s side that’s one thing, there are a million apartments in queens that you can easily afford you can easily afford to buy a nice condo in southern brooklyn, you should try it. some of them even have yards and are near public transit. shocking, i know. easy solution is to get out of manhattan or downtown brooklyn. i make <3k every month after taxes and 401k chill this isn’t an america issue. it’s an nyc issue. it’s the same thing in london, singapore. you live in the most expensive city in your country, you don’t get to own. it’s that simple. you’d need old money, a startup, to cheat/steal or hit it big.   you probably need a dual income of 300k+ to own comfortably in manhattan. about 14k take home and $6,000 on mortgage and whatever else [deleted] yeah, i'm from the bay area and i'm stunned by the market here.  i have a perk at work that gives me $50 per day for lunch and dinner, which is $1000/month in savings. i try to never buy my own food. that's really the only thing making me not want to yeet myself off my (1-bed) window. that’s why i didn’t have much fun as a 20-something, but commuted from nj.  bought a condo in 2001.  banked $80k on sale in 2008, just before gfc.  was able to roll that into a fair bit more.  i still regret not living in nyc in my 20s, right up until i remember i can retire at 55.  ymmv. fuck you! the rest of us do fine. eat shit. even if america got its shit together it doesn't change the fact that nyc is the most in-demand city. not everyone can have a home here, it's physically impossible. it's a city that most people dont retire in for a good reason. there are plenty of cities where you can live with that money, this isn't an american problem, it's a problem that can't be solved because it's a supply and demand issue. you have to encourage the city to build more (but good luck getting that to happen, we are at the lowest vacancy rate and lowest building rate). roommates bro the rental market in nyc is crazy. but it's not bc of the economy. it's bc wealthy neighborhoods refuse to build more housing.  separately, your post suggests you live alone.... so why do you need a two bedroom? this comment is not at all coming from a place of judgment, just hoping to give some perspective. even after my husband and i got married we lived with a roommate for 2 years until we could afford our own place. we did not make as much as you do, and we lived in deep brooklyn and had to commute. everyone i knew in the city at that time had roommates. if you lived alone we all knew your parents paid your rent.   even my brother (10 years younger) complains about rent prices, but he makes more than double what i made at his age, and the rent prices haven’t doubled since then. my old apartment right now is renting for 15% more than when i lived there. he just wants “to live alone.” meanwhile, i was able to live in a much bigger apartment with lots of windows and space to host parties because we were willing to share the kitchen and living room with a friend.  there’s nothing wrong with wanting to live alone and setting a goal for yourself to afford a one bedroom or studio just for yourself, but i’m getting at the constant discussion online and in the media about how unaffordable it is to rent, yet nobody is ever talking about how they’re willing to share with roommates. this has been going on over on tiktok too. like yes. nyc is an unaffordable place to live alone as a single person in a 1br. there is a supply/demand issue there. but did people forget that roommates are a thing? is there a reason current single folks are not considering roommates? if you have no children, why would you want to spend so much money just to be the only one with a key? i’m genuinely curious…not judgmental at all, and if something greater has shifted culturally i’m really keen to hear about it. if   i always felt that for the earning potential in nyc, it’s actually an extremely affordable city to live in as long as you’re willing to accept some alternative qol terms, like renting a room as opposed to a house. move to queens or brooklyn or jersey city so you contribute probably fully to your pension and ira and whining about taking home 6k a month? dude i’m literally in the same boat. there is no way to save in this city unless you live rent free with family. even if you get a room and pay like $1000 its still not realistic to save up for a house here after all taxes and expenses upper manhattan is still manhattan - alot in your price range to rent up there, most rent stabilized. even way above 145th = 20-ish min to midtown. if i had your income i would have bought years ago of but of course not  house  in the nyc area. i accepted that buying a home was no longer in my cards when covid gave the inflated real estate market steroids and, decided to accept circumstances as is. i might as well enjoy other things in life so now i am moving to nyc area  from the se states.  it's not you it's the area. you can easily find a good apartment outside of nyc under 2k. i feel like i missed something; you seem like make more than enough after taxes and whatnot to get a decent place in the city by yourself. are you trying to living in a super popular neighborhood or something? this might be one of the most entitled posts i’ve ever ever seen this might be one of the most entitled posts i’ve ever ever seen i think this could really be interpreted so many different ways by different people - i will lead with, if you can’t manage 2k rent on that kind of salary you’re not going to be able to own a house either… regardless of the city. i own a house in nashville on the outskirts of town in a lightly populated area and my all mortgage costs are $1600, but once you add in all the other expenses that come with owning a home it could easily pass that 2k threshold monthly. (single story ranch - 3b/2ba, 1800 sq ft)  i also rent a 1 bedroom apartment in hamilton heights that i’ve been in for 3 years - i love this neighborhood, rent is $1,995 for a studio (all i need as i am a transient resident here working and also maintaining my tennessee residence). i make 85/90k a year and have had no issue living comfortable in nyc. i will say i might be a little more creative and willing to seek out the best alternatives - usually shop in bulk, will take the train/bus to nj for the malls, live within my means. i am married so my partner covers all the costs of our tennessee household and i cover my living expenses here.. i’ve been able to save and send money back every month since i moved here with no issue.    this isn’t to bash you or anyone else! i just don’t want everyone to read this post and assume it’s impossible to live here - especially with that kind of income. if we are being honest once you pass 110th street/bronx you could easily live somewhere affordable. there’s options.  good luck and i hope all works out with things for you!! i pay $1000 a month in jackson heights and have a fully renovated first floor studio. for like $1700 i could get a 1br.  move to queens. save yourself significant amounts of money. be inconvenienced by 30 mins at most i’ll stop you at “though this sounds like a lot”. that statement might be true for memphis, or oklahoma. but in nyc you’re at that “just about decent livable wage” category. i've had studio apartments for most of my time in the city and it's been fine. renting here is so expensive, but studios are at least a bit cheaper. vote for pro housing development policies, the problem is lack of supply in nyc gotta support the yimbys for new housing. the housing shortage is bad for everyone you put money in for a pension? or do you mean 401k? yes - buying is out of reach for many new yorkers. you can buy a home in ny with that salary and your mortgage will probably be cheaper than rent. it just depends on the location. 120k too but \~6k after tax, you're only left with $3k? what are you spending the other 3k on pension/iras, that's good to save as much as 50%,but most suggest saving 20%. you'll have more flexibility, but ultimately everything is about improving your income. and eat less out.       should be able to get $2-3k with this amount without being reckless if you have some savings, and stable job. unless you’re extremely rich it’s better to rent in nyc in your 20s then move job and location in your 30s.  not everybody can expect to buy a 2 bed apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the world. current interest it sucks alot😪 i’m assuming that you live in nyc? if so look into and this goes for everyone who lives here in nyc 20/80 rental buildings. these are mostly those new shiny buildings going up, lots on the west side. they either rent or bought the land from the city for a buck maybe a smidge more. under the contract that they were able to get the land they have to allow for 20% of the apartments available for medium to low income tenants. these fuck’rs (management) don’t make it easy but not impossible. sometimes there only open one day a week for a few hours. persistence can pays off. there’s also mitchell lama. check them out at nyc.gov having to pay property taxes (come from a coubtry that doesnt really have this..)  each year on a house i own is ridiculous as well as whopping interest rate.  i have no idea how i will manage to buy a house when these wall street bois bring cash to pay for 1 mil houses. america won't get this sh*t together cuz guess what this is the og capitalism here. i think i will be stuck forever with my landlord at williamsburg (1.5br) for 1.8k / mo. unsure where you’re looking in the city but my building’s property company owns a few buildings and i pay $2150 (moved in 4 years ago paying $1850) and i make $112k. you might be able to get in lower to start. also if you’re open to it, look at studios too. i live in one and love it. often times 1-bedrooms are smaller apartments overall bc of the bedroom wall.   company: marfam realty co  (i’m in yorkville right near the q) it’s wild how even with a solid salary, the cost of living still squeezes so hard. maybe consider looking at nearby cities or towns with slightly lower costs? sometimes a short commute can save a ton while still keeping you close to the action. i make about $120k i just don’t spend $2k on rent. i’m in a rent stabilized one bed for $1400, it was $1350 when i signed. thats how i live on my own, i also have two jobs. homeowning is overrated i got lucky. my cousin bought a home with his wife and gave me his 2 bedroom uws apartment and the rent is $1200. this is not a solution but something you should be doing since you have an incredible ami band you fall into - the nyc lottery. your chances are higher to get called because so many people don’t fall where you do. best of luck. one of the reasons i am not leaving my current place is because i got it during covid and my salary was under 100k. started with 1650 as a studio in an elevator building, currently it’s 1750. i wanted to get a real 1 br but with where things stand, i’d rather save more as the studio is more than enough for my needs it didn’t sound like a lot… it’s not america’s problem, it’s nyc’s problem. i agree, but. your “issue” is that you are saving. i am willing to bet that many don’t in order to pay for the rent and live comfortably or to be able to buy. if you can’t afford to rent in nyc, what makes you think you can afford to buy? 120k is fine if you have roommates. no where near enough to be on your own in most areas. it’s not impossible but very difficult to find a place that you can afford on your own. move to westchester if you want a house then maybe you should do roomates and save the other half you would have on rent. people in america always want everything and not sacrifice a little. i live at home making six figures only because i want an investment property or home in the next 2 years renting sucks the wind. i live on the island and have until halloween to gtfo after 24 years (rip my favorite holiday and normal life)  thankfully, i acquired a lead for labor housing that my company owns at 2800/mo for a 2bd1ba, 20x20 deck, relatively decent storage, huge livingroom, we can paint the interior and bring our own shit, all included sans cable starting mid sept.   the terrible thing with this is that i'll be beholden to this company until the day i die bc literally no one else allows dogs.   pet owner advocacy: if you can't care for them when/if you have 3 months to move, you shouldn't have an animal that others wouldn't accept. you took them in and it's your job to make sure that the sentient albeit non reasoning non human isn't cast off because you can't provide.   sorry. not really.  oops. the boomers in these condos won’t let us in either find a location with a 30 year co-op mortgage plan.with a good interest rate. this is a parody, yeah?   i suppose all things are relative. i hope nothing really difficult befalls your existence. the only way to rent on your own in this city is to find a really shabby apartment ….or a rent stabilized one. same , i made 128k and still struggle in nyc . live on my own , it’s horrible as a born and raised new yorker, i left nyc after 5 years. i got sick and tired of continually being broke even after having a great job. honestly, if you don’t have at least 2-3 other sources of income, it’s tough to really make it.   my best piece of advice depending on your age and your situation, if you have non toxic parents, i say move back in with them and try to save as much as possible. another option, live with roommates and live below your means. create a budget plan that is actually possible, one that fits in misc. items as well. within nyc, brooklyn and queens are best to live with roommates and still live below your means. if you really neeed to live on your own, move within the tri-state area and commute. jersey is probably the best option, especially if you want to still experience nightlife. connecticut is honestly way too far but if you don’t go out as much, it’s a more feasible option.   and don’t buy a house in nyc, i would recommend buying upstate, long island, or consider moving out of state. eventually, with this housing market what goes up, must come down. don’t stress!!   godspeed to you 🤞 i’m in the same boat as you. unfortunately i’ve put off the need to live alone for so long living here but it’s time for me to go :( i wish i could make what you make i make a lot less 50k for the year with me doing a lot of over time. rent is through the roof i live in a crappy area extremely dangerous and i never can get any sleep.  the ppl who live above me sleep during the day don’t work live off the system & have a bunch of kids they start waking up around 3-4p smoking weed most of the day cuz the smell comes into my place and blast music all night the ppl above them and myself have complained to the cops and management millions of times and nothing gets done fk nyc i wish i could make what you make i’ll do the 2 hr drive just to get sleep 😴 i want to move but i can’t afford it. my daughter and boyfriend want to move to ny that the latest thing for young adults  out of college from ca.  i am in san diego and though  expensive would not leave the sunshine .. she just moved to sf by the marina. it reminds me of a ny city block . i was pleasantly surprised how nice, clean and how many young professionals were there, considering all  the bad news about sf lately . just wait til you have a crappy landlord, an insane neighbor, and mice. you simply don’t make enough money to live alone comfortably in nyc. there are many other more affordable cities in america though. rent in li or further out in qu/si are super cheap comparatively.  lirr is expensive but if you’re hybrid it’s not bad and still works out way cheaper.  save your money. buy a house out of ny.  the city isn’t what is used to be, and you have to consider what type of city it’ll be in 10/20yrs and if you would still want to live here/start a family.  yes the city is “fun.” but i live comfortably af with far less money, and have a lot more fun than most people i know. (granted i don’t have a spouse/kids rn)  finally, dual incomes sound like it would make your city life livable. consider dating. people are in similar spots to you and you might fall for someone awesome and can build together.  good luck there are hundreds of thousands of people who have the same view as you, let alone all the corporations and foreign buyers. the only solution is to build more, but zoning and other building limitations restricts that then people say “why waste on rent when you can buy and use that $$ for a mortgage” because you fools, show me a home you can buy with a 3k mortgage….. i am nyc born and bred. i missed the window when homes were “reasonable” because i was in my 20’s, single and admittedly an idiot with my $$$ and life. i don’t have “generational” wealth, my older brother married into a two family in sunnyside(cha chiiiiing for him). i make 160k a year, my husband makes over 100k and we still are at a loss of how to afford a house.  just sucks. my whole family is here, my husband will always work in manhattan… so it is what it is.  rant over. needless to say, i get it. good luck out there. also, try woodside queens. still somewhat “reasonable” rent. most people aren't able to contribute to their pension and an ira but i do feel ya, i live in brooklyn making very similar money and after all my savings stuff i'm left not that much. welcome! you’ve discovered the american dream!!!😴 easy. they live within their means. you can’t afford the “half decent” neighborhoods, whatever that means.   and yeah, you don’t make enough to buy a house anywhere nearby. did you just discover this housing market? i know you’re just venting so feel free to disregard this until you want to get a balanced opinion on your situation.  — with your income this seems around a 50% needs 30% wants 20% savings budget and is doable in new york city. if you take home about $5800 /month after taxes but also after your various retirement accounts, that means really you’re probably actually putting around 5-10% of your income into retirement, and you only need to put aside minimum $580 a month on top of that to be on track with recommended savings. (this is not considering whether or not you have already saved for an 3 month emergency fund.)  lets say you spend $2000 on rent, $500 on groceries/eating out for one person, and $500 on your other necessary bills like electric, gas, phone, internet, insurance… that’s $3000 on needs. then aside from the portion already spent on your retirement through your job, you save $580 a month on random savings.. that leave $2220 a month to do whatever else you want with, like subscriptions and  even more eating out and decorating the apartment. if you’re in debt start putting another $500 towards debt payments and you still have so much play money.   unfortunately there are a lot of your colleagues who give the appearance of living it up and having a large apartment and luxuries and look like they are affording it all but are probably in credit card or other kinds of debt, or they come from $300k+ income households, or family gave them seed money.   best of luck dude. lifestyle creep is a bitch and bougie wasteful spoiled “young professionals” in nyc will swindle you into spending more than you need when you can be perfectly happy and enjoy tons of what nyc has to offer on your 6 figure income. nyc has some of the best free fun in the country between museums, art galleries, libraries, block parties, free concerts, parks, etc. move to nj nyc is not the place really unless you are wealthy/upper upper middle class (over 1 million a year income). it will be very hard. “pension, iras…”   only very recently did i make less than half of you and live alone in a one bedroom apartment. it wasn’t nice and wasn’t in a great neighborhood. bou can’t have everything - life is about compromises. i’ll tell you what i did.  i saved up, got a broker, was a delight and one day told him, hey if you have a rent stabilized apartment i’m ready to put a deposit down right away, let me know if you come across that.  sure enough one day i get a call at noon.  broker says, i have a place, haven’t showed it to anyone and the ad isn’t up yet.  if you can come now, you’ll be the first to see it.  it was a 3 bedroom 1 bath for $2599 in prospect heights, rent stabilized.  my spouse and i had been looking for 1 bedrooms between $3200-$3500.  it needed some love, but we painted, changed a few things, and it’s a nice place.  the other day we were on zillow looking at comprable places that cost between $5k-$6k.  it was worth the fee, we’re staying here for a while. and in the long run we’re saving tons. i was making more than that and decided to leave nyc look up hdfc co-ops. they have income limits but many you'd still be below. worth owning for sure. also, non-hdfc co-ops. queens is full of safe, maybe not super hip neighborhoods but with affordable co-ops. everyone i know that's really been able to do well for themselves here in the long run started by buying instead of renting, or was able to land a rent-stabilized place. everyone else got jacked up by their rent getting significantly increased and today are paying way too much rent for not enough apartment.   i started out in a co-op in forest hills. studio to 1br then sold that when i landed a rent stabilized place in williamsburg for less than half what market rent would have been for that loft, then saved up a ton from paying pretty low rent for a long time and bought a condo nearby in 2021. it's the key to stability in this city.   i made a lot less than you when i bought that studio (granted, a while ago, nearly 20 years, but a lot less than you, like 40k.) pay your dues in queens! 120k isn’t very much here, considering after taxes that’s like 70-80k, and there’s no way you’re gonna find any decent one bedroom for around 2k, unless it’s in harlem or the deep bronx (maybe the heights). understand your frustration but that’s just the reality of the world right now.  unless you have a ton saved you are simply just not able to afford an apartment in manhattan at this time, simple as that. i make less than you, $92k. it feels hopeless. i literally am budgeting dollars like do i take the subway again or walk an hour? i feel hopeless. i want to see my friends, i want to travel, but by trying to maintain my sanity i get by on nothing for the regular living. saving for a house? what a pipe dream. idk what will happen to me when i’m old. i had a breakdown about it yesterday actually. all these thousands to rent a month, and nothing else. i remember years ago, $90k would have actually meant something in nyc! i met people who made $100k and they lived reaaaaally nicely in 2010. that all went up in smoke 🥲 generally speaking, 100k not a lot these days in big cities, 200k is now the number for what you want to do in the way you want to do it. esp factoring in additional state & city income taxes. and with everything so expensive...heck, you need a c-note just in daily walking around / food / car money.  find a way to supplement or increase income- or go frugal / roommate for a few years until you've saved enough.   and no, it's not fixable, barring a depression. excessive money printing, immigration and welfare handouts only drive demand and inflation up (irregardless whether pro or con, these are facts). and to compound, the entire world wants to launder or save their money in our real estate.  you'd be surprised how many denizens make 100-200k in hospitality / service, transport, street vending sectors. and/or how many of them- & those who make less- are willing to cram into one living space, at least for a while, to save up a stash. especially now with open borders.  for real estate you're competing against all that.  even in lesser neighborhoods the demand for space is unreal- they rent bunks barracks style with lockers in shared rooms- 8 hours only per day- $150 weekly.  entire single occupancy room for rent under $1300 monthly is hard to find unless very remote / sketchy area (that's the max amount the city will pay to house a single homeless / indigent).  i mean, the american dream was never a comfortable lifestyle from a young age for everyone without initial extra work and making do with less while saving as much as possible for later on .  set aside some amount every two weeks for bitcoin- and hodl. thank me in a couple years. move 10-15 mile radius from manhattan, if in queens, look for places near the lirr, but that also has a $320 monthly cost, will take you into the city in under 25mins and roommate. this is just the reality of our generation. i make more than you and pay less rent since i live at home and still find it hard to buy a house. if you want to live in nyc, there is nothing wrong with continuing to rent. there are lots of costs with homeownership as well like unexpected repairs, property tax, and insurance. or perhaps look to buy in nj. my brother bought his house a few years ago for 500k. if your goal is to stay under 1 check for mortgage payment it's doable but you won't be in nyc unless you want to live in the outskirts. 3k gets you about 400k-450k home. you can take the metro north out less than a hour and find homes in that range. or long island even i totally agree and understand but you should feel lucky you have enough to contribute to any type of retirement lol this is why i decided not to move to nyc the stress of looking for a place was not it. is living in ny worth it ? this city is for the lower class, glory be to them, not your middle class trash ass /s  they have units reserved for them jn every new building. the poorest and most-glorified of them, illegals migrants, get free hotel housing.  where else on the planet do you have a middle class person paying $4k next door to a low-income crack addict paying $1.5k with his disability money?

(generally i define this as a sub 30-40min commute to midtown, which is a crude calculation but pretty much works)   of course everyone’s standards are different, but this is not reflective of the avg new yorker at all  plenty of people are at or around 30% of income or worse, regardless of what these nvidia / goldman / biglaw people will have you believe. please don’t feel bad or like you aren’t doing enough bc of this thread, and def don’t leave nyc because of it unless it’s truly the right move for you. speaking from experience, a whole lot of these kinds of people (prob some are my colleagues lmao) are quite insufferable and nyc might as well be sf if only the tech bros are left. idk, end rant damn i’m at 3.4k and make ~270k, will be <320k next year, base $195k. feel like i’m paying too much now lol 🫣🫥 2700, ues, 240k in 2004 i paid 1500 for a huge studio on the ues! damn years ago i was renting at $2300, made about $70k. moved in with partner and spent $3600 + got $200k in additional income $140k, $2500, 1br flatbush 200k, 3600 2775/month with 220k base, 400k with bonus and stocks.    ues.  1 bedroom but it's smaller than i'd like.  i might move to a bigger place soon.  i moved to the city last year and my salary was 100k so this was tight for that budget. 2100 rent, 70k income, 1br in les. gf will be moving in soon which will cut rent in half. it’s pricey but i don’t want roommates, can’t do it any longer 1900 1 bed 80-110k $2600 in mortgage on a 600 sq ft 1br on 110th. i make $185k of course people posting here make a lot of money. that’s not surprising. what i’m surprised about is what a small fraction of that income these folks are willing to spend on their apartments. you live there.  i guess the flex is to have a good salary  and be very thrifty at the same time. 90k and $2000 in rent. i live alone in harlem, when i first moved in the rent was $1800. ~50-60k. $1925 in williamsburg. sigh. i want a garage. i miss my car. 60% of income goes to rent. $2050 1 br morningside heights/west harlem. $120k 1br with my partner, 2900. williamsburg. combined income 150k. i know everyone on this thread is amazed at how much people make, but i’m kind of amazed at how little their rents are to that. you’re making 300k and your rent is under 4k a month. thrifty it sounds like everyone’s making a lot, but remember inflation, folks… we got some rich mfers in here… $3250/month 1br in the west village, 100k/yr. not super great but the location and convenience make up for it. i still needed a guarantor to rent. 117k , 2870 rent  holy shit i must be dumb asf 😂 rent is gonna have to go down eventually because onlyfans is getting kind of old. the easy money people are making won’t be there forever. damn, where are y’all finding these deals under $3k? i’m paying $3,100 and make $150k base 😫. it pisses me off so much to see people making 200+k paying 2500-3000 a month and saying their rent is expensive. you're paying and taking away apartments from people who make a fraction of what you make! $2200, $215k income what are your savings goals? one can afford way more housing if they’re not putting anything away. $250k/y - $4000/m for a 750sqf in uws (no doorman) 2100—-100k , ues— walk up & no amenities but it’s technically a 2bedroom.   the other units same size were converted to 1 large bedroom with separate kitchen. mine was the only one kept as a 2 br. $5650 in rent. make around $700k a year. the only way to live in a desirable manhattan neighborhood and pay under 3k for a decent spot is if it’s rent stabilized. so go out there and hustle and find one. me and my friend both just got one. one in chelsea and one in west village 3750 rent uws, 223k. 12’ high ceiling, 750 sq ft. one block from subway station. 230k tc, current rent is 2.5k, but moving in next month to $3.7k.  i’ve done the math - i’ll still be saving a few thousand dollars every month. reasons why: no debt, no car, no pets, and i don’t travel often.  that might change in a few years though when i have to start financially support my single mom. income 140-150. rent is 2700 up in the heights. doable, but not happy about how much i’m pissing away in rent. i usually make 90-100,000 and my rent is currently $1,550. that said i’ve been unemployed for a year, so was on unemployment for six months and now been building a business so not at my previous amount yet. but rent stabilized apartment in inwood is a saving grace gf and i pay 3.8k a month, gross, just north of 1.1m 2 million / $1800 studio washington heights $2,700. about $200k the common calculation is take your income and divide by 40. that’s the maximum you can safely afford according to companies you’ll rent from, without being considered a major risk. i don’t recommend hitting that number, but it’s a *decent* estimation you can use side note: everyone making over 150k a year, what do you do for work? $4100 around chelsea, i don’t have a gross income cus i don’t work ( law student life) lol general rule is not to spend more than 30% of gross income on rent i live in a one convertible two with my wife and toddler. we spend $5300 on $500-550k household income. 3.8k, 650k. les. until recently i was paying 2.8k with roommates. ive always aimed to make my rent in one week while freelancing if that makes sense. like if my rent is $1200/month i should aim to make $1200/week about $220k rent is $2475 for 1 bedroom hells kitchen rent is 4.4k and about 10% of my gross cash comp and 8% of total comp. bed stuy - luxury building   $4k monthly all in - 2 bedroom  $280-400k total comp $2.2k. $103k salary. ues. but it’s more of a studio/jr. 1br. 6k two bedroom pied-a-terre in mid town. around 800k tc. $100k income, $3100 in rent last year bushwick—$71k, $2450/mo for a one bedroom. it’s a huge chunk of my income but i have a barky dog and adhd cleaning issues. worth it to live alone. not manhattan but i make $54k and pay $1200 for a 500 sq ft studio in crown heights \~$150k (base and some freelance) and my rent is $2550 on the ues 1900/85k washington heightz $4890/mo in midtown. combined income with my partner is about $300k $1865, $100k. washington heights, spacious 1bd rm no amenities. 120yo bldg a friend of mine is paying \~$5000 per month on a $200 k salary living in hudson yards.  is that too much?

53,15% brokers fee,"i've had brokers not even show up to the showing lol. they just had the doorman let me in to the unit. trust me, we're all there, just powerless to do anything about it.      still looking for a place, but i understand these non negotiable fees tend to become more negotiable during the fall/winter. if there's someone willing to pay that fee, the brokers will stand their ground and milk it for all its worth until nyc regulations say that they can't.  the issue with nyc is that there's always another person with deep wallets who doesn't care and will continue to pay these kind of fees without question. i've only ever seen ""kiss ass"" fees in asia prior to moving to nyc. i had a broker not show up. she left the keys in a lockbox and allowed me to enter and view the apartment on my own.  she wanted 1 month rent as a fee and kept pressuring me that there were a ton of applications already in so i had to move fast.  it sat on the market for weeks after i declined to apply. 15% and brokers being idiots is a tale as old as time! just like death and taxes! i look at posts that list no or don’t specify a brokers fee.  when i decide i want it i clarify in writing that there was no brokers fee.  if you never signed a paper and they didn’t inherently share at the beginning, it’s a nope for me.  also, you can negotiate it down to one months rent.  the nyc rental brokers are like used care salesmen.  it’s awful! it happened sometime after the financial crisis and its bs. there were fees before but it was 1 month rent. far less than 15% annual. it has and always will be ludicrous. nonsense like this is why i’m probably stuck in my “cheap”, crusty old studio for the foreseeable future lol worked as an agent 20 years ago.  was policy to tell people 15% . often settled for a month's rent. sort street easy by places that are no fee.  do not play their game. this is how i lost my ehv section 8 voucher back in 2022.  i was rewarded a section 8 ehv voucher after being in 2 different shelters in nyc.   my caseworker was trash; she did not help me look for landlords or property managements that accepted section 8 and cityfheps.   when i found someone who would accept my section 8 voucher, my caseworker supplied me with an outdated broker fee voucher form from hra dated in 2013. it was 2022.  i provided the broker with this form, and he did not want to fill out the form to obtain a check from hra, in which the form stated hra will only pay $1000 towards the brokers fee.   i was required to pay this 15% broker fee as well. the rent of the apartment was $2250 per month. so, this fee totaled around $4050 to move in, plus the first month's rent and security deposit.   the landlord was not willing to pay the broker fee and had the utilities cut off upon the time of inspection. i lost my voucher and was not reissued a new voucher, i would have to go back to a shelter to be reissued one.   went back to the shelter, still getting exposed to second-hand crack smoke, gambling addicts and felons. it's a very depressing and dangerous place to live. why has nobody asked this before i don’t care i’ll never pay for a broker. been doing no fee my whole life there's a bill at the city council to make whoever retains the broker pay their fee. i haven't heard anything about it in a few weeks, but light up your council members and your community board and let them know you support it.   https://council.nyc.gov/districts/ always ask broker in initial email correspondence the fee and ask if it's negotiable if you want. factor the fee into the rent. if you plan to be there awhile obviously the fee isnt as big of a deal the broker fee is just a bribe. they provide zero service to you, but you have to bribe them to get the apartment. nyc is one of the most desirable places to live in the world. when there’s demand that strong, people will pay whatever it takes. only thing that can control it is if citizens demand it out of their representatives and vote accordingly. i talk them down, or attempt to, every single time. if they’re a hard ass it’s not the apartment for me. it’s because there are very few units relative to tenants so you don’t have any bargaining power. during the pandemic when units freed up, brokers were taking smaller fees & landlords were paying broker fees and offering rental discounts im about to become a real estate agent! please find someone you like first, someone who actually knows their shit, its honestly embarassing how bad some of these sales agents are. you, the consumer, have the power to put your money into someone's pockets. find a brokerage you like, find an agent who will actually show you multiple places and someone who knows their shit.   its really a shame that 15% is the standard when these bozos don't actually know how to do sales.   also, you can negotiate! hey nyc agent here,  i completely understand the frustration with nyc agents/brokers. hopefully i can provide some context as to why the fees are the way they are.  first of all, there should be a lot of work and expense that goes into listing a property.  here are a few of the things i do when i list a property:  \* look at dozens of comps to understand the market value of the property.  \* have extensive discussions with owners to offer competitive rental rates. owners are sometimes unrealistic about the value of their units and this can generate a lot of back and forth and require a lot of additional research on my end.  \* hire professional photographers and floor plan experts to shoot the property and t it in the best light while also providing lots of context to potential renters.  \* set up multiple open houses and accommodate as many showings as possible. i could show a property dozens of times before it is rented.  \* interact with every interested applicant over the phone and via email. many applicants come direct (i.e. without their own agents), so i spend upwards of an hour just explaining the process to each of them.  \* review each application. ask for additional required documentation if necessary.  \* guide the tenant through the board application process. provide them resources on writing high quality referral letters and accurately portraying their financials.  \* follow up with the management company every few days to make sure the application is moving along promptly.  \* prep the candidate for their board interview (if required).  tldr; a lot of work goes on behind the scenes that many tenants might not see.  a couple of other things i'd like to note:  \* if you hire your own representative, you do not pay any more than the 15% fee. when i represent tenants, i split the 15% with the listing agent.  \* there are definitely bad agents out there and they give the rest of us a bad name. i'm sorry to anyone who felt they had to deal with a surly/unresponsive/mean broker.  \* the agent does not keep the 15%. agents split the fee with the brokerage they work for. we are required by ny law to work under a brokerage as agents. most large brokerages start their agents off at less than a 50/50 split.  personally, i was a software engineer at google for almost a decade before i became an agent. this is a very different industry and there are things about it i wish i could change. however, the industry is becoming more transparent, which i believe is a good thing.  best of luck to everyone out there apartment hunting. let me know if there are any questions i can answer.  warm regards,   kristen shaker i’ve been saying this all month (apartment hunting again). when the hell did we go from a month to 15% and just “accept” it?? also why am i paying a brokers fee to some agent who did nothing more than list the apartment and unlock it for me? i had to find the listing, reach out to schedule a viewing, do the measurements, and ask every question because they don’t list/know anything about the unit/building? i didn’t hire them therefore i shouldn’t have to pay the fee, the landlord should since they hired them to list the place and find a tenant search with spite for apartments listed by landlord or owners. fuck brokers sorry to sound dumb, but 15% is for the whole year of rent? not 15% of 1 month rent?   why would you pay 7-10,000 to someone just to rent an apartment? that seems like way too much. in my experience, born and raised new yorkers don't fuck around with brokers. it's usually transplants who don't know as much who fall for the scam. is %15 the max they can charge (suppose to charge) or do they do more? dont do it [deleted] i had a broker show me a no fee apartment after me telling him i didn't want to pay a fee, and then try to charge me a fee. the worst part is that the no fee building viewed me as his client and wouldn't rent to me without going through him. what heavy lifting?  i’m about ready to leave the city over broker fees. it really limits mobility. i’m in a situation where i want to get out of my apartment, but i’m not sure how much longer i will stay in the area. don’t really want to pay 15% for an apartment i might have for a year or less.  this has all made me realize just how stagnant this city can be. probably thousands of people in similar situations, stuck with family, or stuck living with a partner they want to leave, and none of them can move bc of the damn broker fee. don’t be afraid to negotiate that fee. brokers expect you to, but if you don’t they’re not going to cut you any breaks. it is ridiculous but what u can do? real receipt? glad all you folks have $10,000 lying around🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ 15%?! shii i wish!. in long island it seems like the standard for brokers fee is equal to one months rent! i never rented a single place where i had to pay broker fees. have i ever talked to brokers and consider for fee places? for sure. but i realized that it’s not even worth engaging with them, since 99% of them are unprofessional and not worth a dime for the type of attitude and work they do the problem is ultimately the sheer volume of people looking for apartments and how competitive it is. as you stated they can literally do nothing and collect a huge commission check. until there are consequences that impact their bottom line (like people refusing to rent if they act that way) nothing will change nyc brokers are completely useless, never sign anything refuse to sign apartments that require broker fee. 1 month is already criminal broker fee on rentals to me never makes sense   i believe landlords should pay that fee brokers are useless. brokers seem to forget that it wasn’t that long ago that it was easy renting an apartment directly through the ll or management company of the building who used to run the background/credit/salary check themselves. nyc council needs to sign and enforce the bill sitting on the desk for ll who choose to use a broker being responsible for paying the broker fee like most places outside nyc. this happens in other mega cities. its not a feature of just new york. somehow its also the norm in tokyo and london.  in most other cities you basically have leasing offices that manage large properties or property managers that act as leasing agents. but in these mega cities you basically have a lot of small landlords, so they essentially hire brokers to facilitate what a leasing office is supposed to do (i.e. show apartments, process applications etc.) ive lived here 12 years and thought that was the norm…. just go to the leasing office in the building...",293,129,negative,0.7395760416984558,422,"is a bribe. they provide zero service, but you have to bribe them to get the apartment.s willing to pay. i’ve seen brokers not show up to showings. they just let me in. i’ve had brokers not show up to showings. i’ve had brokers not show up to showings. i’ve had brokers not show up to showings. i’ve had brokers not show up"
54,I am so tired of dealing with the people who work in this profession,"the reality is that 90-95% of all agents suck, and i say that as an agent. at any given minute you can run into a newer agent, and because 85% of new brokers don't renew their license after the first two years, you can end up dealing with someone pretty terrible. i am sorry to hear it's been so stressful, even as someone who does this for a living, apartment hunting can be stressful and not fun to do personally and professionally, i can only imagine what it's like for people not in real estate who aren't used to the nonsense.  getting your own broker can definitely help get the job done, and quickly, but i find that it's much harder at lower price points to find a broker willing to help. are you looking under $2500? a real estate agent in nyc for rentals is a fake job. they actually do nothing. i had to let myself into an apartment to see it and the broker still wanted 15% 🤣🤣🤣🤣 agree. having recently moved, i would honestly pay a premium for a mom & pop building where i could just deal directly with the owners next time i need to look.   i have yet to encounter a broker who did anything but complicate the process while rent seeking on doing the absolute bare minimum. various different brokers have been giving tours to prospective tenants of my current apartment which i am moving out of in a month. they could stand to make thousands of dollars if they can get the people to rent the apartment, but they won’t even bother to pick up the 2 dead cockroaches in the hall outside the apartment. normally i used to do that myself but why would i make their job easier. rent directly from the management company and skip the broker.  look for no fee listings on streeteasy. i have a broker who is actually really nice and knowledgeable. unfortunately, we still deal with the owners brokers and some of them should not be in this buisness. scumbags. unprofessional. really feel your pain. i do recommend a broker. they can help you find places not listed yet and one who has been in the business for awhile will also know the brokerages to avoid. good luck. hang in there. feels like you’re filling in details in your own head for why you’re not getting approved.    why would a broker show you apartments that they knew 100% they weren’t going to rent to you?  that’s a waste of their own time too.  and a deposit was already put down on another - did they tell you that during the viewing or did you take too long to apply and someone got in before you?  4 months is a long time to be looking if you’re serious about wanting to move. sure you’re not dragging your feet in some regards? it’s crazy you give 12% of your annual rent directly to an agent just for you to have to do everything their way. agent i just paid for my new apartment has been requiring we cater to her when it comes to days and times meeting. it’s a long shot but have you tried any of the “newer” buildings that are no fee? honestly most of them start at like $3k i think thou, but i’ve seen a few that were closer to 2400. i got so disgusted with it, i moved back to texas after staying in random airbnbs for a year.    i got tired of the no pets, $4000 fee for a dump, $2000 for a guarantor, even thou i was willing to pay  1 year up front, when the broker told me, well what about the second year? i hung up and reluctantly went back to sorry ass texas. what kind of apartment are you looking for? i have a 2 bedroom in bushwick with a yard, i'm looking to downsize to a studio if i can get a lease takeover. i can't believe the amount of bs in this thread. have you ever tired just simply walking around your neighborhoods of desire and looking for physical signs seeking tenants???? (ya it’s called analog )   you don’t have to do though the yuppy trash brokers for eveything nyc rentals ya know   plenty of mom and pop vibe landlords with extra apartments that hate brokers too   source : found my apt this way been here almost 8 years [deleted]",289,66,negative,0.7351478934288025,355,. i'm looking for a studio in brooklyn. i'm looking for a 2 bedroom in brooklyn. i'm looking for a studio in brooklyn. i'm looking for a 2 bedroom in brooklyn. i'm looking for a studio in brooklyn. i'm looking for a 2 bedroom in brooklyn. i'm
55,I make $22 an hour is a shelter my only option ,"22$/hr can get you a room? just need to find you a budget to go around. minimum 900-1000/month i think mostly you’re looking in the wrong places. a nice room in a nice apartment is going to be much more visible on this subreddit than a small room in a less expensive apartment.   check somewhere like the gypsy housing nyc facebook group. you can find rooms there for 1000 or 1100 a month, and some for even less. these are a lot more affordable, and there are some decent apartments on there. (the name comes because it was originally a group for struggling actors/musicians to find housing, i think, but now it’s for anyone).   if you’re queer, and you want queer roommates, queer housing nyc (also a facebook group) is a good option as well, and many rooms are in the same price range or lower.   i recommend a shelter only as a last resort, because i think it’s very important to have a room/have space to yourself. [deleted] spareroom.com  make it work to answer your other question though - from my experience, many if not most people in the shelters are working, sometimes even two jobs. it can be really tough. look in the bronx, queens, and parts of brooklyn. for manhattan your best bet is to find an apt with roommates or maybe taking on another job. that's wildly unnecessary, there's plenty to rent on spareroom for under 1200 [deleted] you can get a room. i live in southside for 800. budget and get a guarantor i would suggest looking outside manhattan, but even in manhattan there are rooms in your budget ofc they won't be very big, look on roomie, gypsy housing, nyc rooms for front in facebook the post right above this is for a room in williamsburg for 1475....  there's also a post for rooms in fort greene for 1050... $22 an hr is actually pretty decent. if you can help it, stay out of the new york city shelter system. its remarkable how no one is grasping op’s point. yeah you can technically find rooms for 22 an hour, but you should be able to have your own apartment for minimum wage. anywhere. its beyond messed up that rooms are going for over 2000 (rooms. in a shared apartment.) beyond sharing 1 toilet and 1 shower with 5 roommates, and commuting 40 minutes to work, 22 an hour gets you pretty much nowhere. especially considering that you have to make 40x your rent for your application to even get approved. the housing market is fucked. that's what i make you can get a spot w roommates forsure just aim for like crown heights or harlem and you might even get some decent space. you might be able to find a room in a public housing or even a room farther out. my uber driver rents a basement flat for i think it was 1300 a month around laguardia how many hours are you working? hi, i’m going to be subletting my studio soon ( it’s rent stabilized) 1500. it’s in dumbo. contact if interested! ( female 29) i’m on 16/hr and was debating a shelter tonight b/c unsafe roommate situation , hope something changes where everyone who works can afford a safe space of their own someday. people paying $2k+ a month to live with roommates are generally living in a select few “trendy” manhattan or bk neighborhoods and/or in luxury buildings. from 2014-2021, i paid $575-$650 a month for a room in astoria, which would be affordable on a $22 an hour salary. raised in nyc, now living in nj, will soon be moving  back becase nj sucks, heres my take: -you don’t need roommates but if you want to live in certain areas and not pay an absurd price that is the best idea. its become almost some sort of culture to like need a roommate here.  -i don’t feel like you should pay more than $1000 for a room and that is possible. you just have to look for it.  -i see that getting a reasonably priced and prolly rent stabilized apartment is possible when you pay a broker, so try to save up like 5 months if you can -apply for housing connect, it may seem like a stretch, but not impossible  - live reasonably and you won’t struggle, i make $24hr currently and lots of new yorkers dont make 6 figures. trust me, as someone who used to live in the shelter, that should be your last resort. i still have a bit of lingering trauma from being in there.  i live in a single room occupancy. meaning my apartment is the literally just the room and the kitchen and bathroom are shared. try looking into those, or just looking for a room somewhere in an affordable area! the shelters don’t have much help in helping you get steady on your feet and can be very abusive.   wishing you luck! get a room for around $1k, it’s doable. you’re looking in the wrong places, friend. been in west harlem for 4 years (3 different apts) and never paid more than $1450 for a room. never been more than 10 minutes from the subway.  steer clear of luxury buildings and trendy neighborhoods. accept that you will have roommates. sublease a room to avoid income requirements. roomi is your friend. there are many working people in shelters. however, shelter life can be very difficult. many of the low income individuals i know end up splitting studios or 1brs between 3+ people so they can get on their feet. i work in a shelter and have worked at a few across brooklyn manhattan and the bronx. from my perspective and what i’ve heard from co workers shelters are typically terrible. there’s no saying how long you’ll be in one given that everyone case is different but considering you have a job that makes a decent amount. if you manage your finances, keep up with your case manger, and do as they as, & start doing your own work to move out you shouldn’t be in longer than 2/3 months. a few tips if you do go - try to have a lower $ amount on the 4 pay stubs you’ll be showing your case manager for your voucher. - definitely do some apartment searching on your own - if you believe your case manager isn’t working for you ask to be put on someone else’s case load. god some of you are so dramatic, must be insufferable. you are way above minimum wage you've never even sniffed a shelter i live in queens for around 1.1k a month, 2 roomies and in-unit washer/dryer + proper ac. easy commute to manhattan. utilities and wifi are like an extra ~80 on my part. even after taxes, 22 an hour would be *plenty* living in a shelter is not going to be pleasant at all and is not sustainable. you are way better off finding a room for $1000. live normally and within your means try looking for a roommate uhm, no. $22 an hour can definitely get you a room. i see in other comments you're working 40 hours per week. $22 \*40 \* 50 weeks (2 weeks off) = \~$44k per year or $3600 per month. what do you spending habits look like?   there are plenty of rooms for rent that would fit your budget and they will be vastly superior to a shelter. something isn't adding up here... maybe just move out of the city? you’ll have a much better quality of life living somewhere more affordable i wouldn’t recommend it if you are a woman.  definitely look into facebook groups for shared housing, there are better options out there if you are working 40 hours a week at this rate! don’t lose hope 🤍  you’ll find something in your budget, finding a place is so stressful but keep looking. and be ready to hop on an opportunity when you see a good place. make sure to check /ask about any pests in the apartment before you sign! are you eligible for public assistance? you could apply for section 8 vouchers but some landlords are reluctant to accept them (this is illegal but hard to enforce) you can do it if you pay ~$1000 per month in rent. there are a lot of shared apartment situations that would get you there why do you stay in nyc? you do not make a living wage. why choose to live in a shelter? be smart about life. you aren’t thriving there. not to be rude but some of you are so dramatic. i lived in nyc on $40k a year (~$20/yr) and never went near a shelter.  there are dozens of apartments in harlem (i have friends that like hamilton heights near the 1 train), bushwick, ridgewood, crown heights, prospect lefferts, etc that have 3 beds for <$3,250. pick any of those, get two roommates making $43k/year each, and you’ll be fine. bells subtract icky frightening long history consist steep rustic hungry   *this post was mass deleted and anonymized with [redact](https://redact.dev)* i feeel you on this, i work full time making $23 an hr and it’s depressing looking at the rent situations. it’s absolutely criminal that (for the most part) the most $900/$1000 in rent can get you in nyc is a room. unless you get lucky and find a studio with a kitchen and bathroom. i see my friends in other states making less than me but being able to afford their own studios with mostly everything included and a ton of space wtf no i mean, based on your responses it doesn't really seem like you want an answer. so yes, a shelter is your only option now. happy? am i crazy? 22 an hour means 3500 a month. many people spend 50% or more of their paychecks on rent. you will be fine try “settled living.com” they sell rooms and you can find some for hella cheap i have the biggest room in the appt and i pay 1300 it’s my limit but fairly good for any found a nice room for my sister on this subreddit for $850 literally 2 months ago. was legit and all. you just gotta keep an eye out on here shelter, or staten island yeah i hope you can get an sro if you do have to go into a shelter where are you living now? what neighborhoods are you looking in? check the canarsie courier for room rentals. also start applying to housing lotteries on housing connect. for a second job look into hotels, they're hiring like crazy right now. you can get $22 outside of nyc and live comfortable and be able to go to the city on the weekends. ask around people you know, people you work with, etc. often rooms for rent are by word of mouth. that budget is tight, but you might be able to find something (likely not in manhattan, at least not below 125th street) no. i don't think moving to a shelter is your only option or even really a option you should consider try looking in south brooklyn. my bf lives in bay ridge and pays 2100 for a massive 2 bed look in flatbush, ocean hill, bay ridge. people will rent you a room that’s more affordable and those areas have reliable subway lines so you aren’t too far out. (i live in brooklyn so i’m more familiar with bk but you can also do the same in bx and queens, i’m just not as familiar with what neighborhoods there would be your best bet) you’ve got to look at different areas. i have friends in crown heights, flatbush, kensington, ridgewood, all paying $1100 or less with 2-3 roommates. i think my first salary in nyc was $55k a year (which i believe is around $22 an hour) and i made do with roommates! my coworkers would do a 2-3 bed flex in manhattan. it’s def possible! you just have to be happy with making your little space completely yours and not expecting that you’ll be able to afford a 1 bed in the city. parts of astoria queens 1br 1500-1700 find a roomate and split rent i survived on less. i rented a room with 2 older people. all included for $800.00 per month. renthop and hotpads also list rooms! there were quite a few nice options when i was looking for apartments you can absolutely live in the city (even in manhattan, if you’re okay with a smaller space and roommates) on $22/hr. but my advice would be to check out queens. go to queens, bronx, or deeper brooklyn. try spare room. that’s how i found my first roommate arrangement look on craigslist plenty of rooms for 1000 or less. i pay 650 in queens for a room. just look. i have a friend who was making roughly the same last year and was able to find multiple rooms in and around bedstuy for around 800 not sure how much things have changed, but i got a room with the roomie app in 2018 for $700.  lived there for 5 years and just moved out earlier this yesr into a 1 bedroom i purchased $22/hr x 40 hours a week x 50 weeks/year equals $44,000 a year. after taxes you should take home $34,142 or $2,845 a month take home.   messed on the 40x rent rule you should be able to qualify for a room that is $1,100 a month. that leaves you with $1,745 a month for bills, food, and a little fun. that is very doable. you should be able to find a room in the $900-$1000 range to save you a little more money. that would leave you with $1.945 - $1,845 a month for bills, food, and fun. many rooms in outer boroughs for less than 1k. my friend rented a room in ridgewood right next to the subway for 900, another friend in astoria for about 800. yes they are small rooms farther from manhattan. but these neighborhoods are great and usually give you access to more affordable food and entertainment options too.  i was making 21$/hour last year and paying 1200 for a room in les - stupid i know but it was short term - it was insanely hard and i was left with pennies every month but i did it. if you're outside manhattan your options will become much cheaper. check out sunset park or sunnyside. respectfully if you’re working in upper manhattan/bronx just move to jersey and get a room. bergen county is expensive but nowhere near those prices you said. if you in work lower manhattan/brooklyn, move to jersey city as those areas are easily accessible from there. find an apartment with roommates, or a room share if you make $22 an hour and work 40 hours a week, then you take home about $2500 a month. you can afford to spend about $1000 on a room in a shared apartment, and there are lots of those options throughout new york, though they may not be in prime locations - think deeper in queens, south brooklyn, or the bronx. i know it must feel that way, but you can manage to rent a room from someone in the upper boroughs or upper manhattan.  i know times have changed, but i made less than that a decade ago and rented rooms in less desirable areas. it sucks, but it’s doable. hopefully over time you’ll work your way out of it !  also, sadly, living with a significant other can help. being single blows if you’re at that income. honestly this is an ignorant question and disrespectful to people that actually need shelter placement. and that kind of attitude may be what’s contributing to you having difficulty finding the type of place you want it's nice for responders to suggest public housing or affordable housing.  but my 2cents--the waitlists for nycha is decades long--it's not really an option.  and affordable housing lotteries are a laugh--my adult kid has been on those and they are lotteries and then when an apt comes up it's still $2100+ a month.  i think a share is the only option tbh for many. try getting a roommate or be someone's roommate.   a shelter is going to be hell so try not to go to one.   moving out of nyc is also an option if you don’t mind brooklyn, queens or the bronx. im going to recommend some neighborhoods and some places to look: listings project, atlas rooms, and check out nyc housing fb groups. look for niche community groups. i have friends who are renting places for $800-$1000 for a room but be aware you’ll definitely need roommates.   you can find a room in a safe fun area if you are picky and look very hard some suggestions are   queens: ridgewood, jackson heights, kew gardens, etc obviously the further out the cheaper the place  brooklyn: sunset park, flatbush, bed stuy, prospect park/ lefferts garden, some parts of bushwick shit, my fiancee and i just got a room in the south bx for $500 a month. it's a 2 bdrm and we have the living room. they accepted our cats and utilities/wifi included. i make close to $70k and am just using this spot to save the amount of money needed to get our own apartment. that's the only gripe i have about nyc apartments. it costs first month, last month, security fee, brokers fee, moms fee, dads fee, every damn fee ever just to move in! in what universe are rooms $2500??? you can get a 2-3 bedroom apartment for that price. what neighborhoods are you looking in? 22*40 = 880/week and for a year that is 42k idk why you think you need to spend 1800 for a room. i can google rn and find 1 bedroom apt in bensonhurst bk for 1400. manhattan isn’t the only place to live in, we have a subway for a reason. you could definitely find a room for 900/mo somewhere in brooklyn. so many people i know live in 5bd apts with a bunch of roommates and one shared bathroom for a similar rate and it is undoubtedly a better option than a shelter. don't fall for scams like june homes, but look on all the popular websites (streeteasy, zillow, craiglist) and reach out to as many people as possible that fit your needs and budget. it is a lot of work unfortunately, but it's doable. the high prices you see are because people from out of state decide they're ok with paying so much because they get to live in nyc, and/or want to live in luxury areas. get roommates? you’ll be fine i made that much when i first moved to new york and found a perfectly good room in bushwick for 975. i pay $850 a month. it’s possible you shouldn’t have too much trouble finding a room in a shared apartment for $900ish. check out the spareroom app, it’s one of the few services actually worth paying for. $10 for the month to see places all over the city. i don't even live in nyc but another hcol area with similar prices and, i just don't believe you can't find a room to rent. i’ve been living in a shelter for 4 years now. yes there’s are “working man” shelters but they get the crazies and the fiends as well. last month i was sucker punched in the face in my room. other than stuff like that you will get a bed and food. lots of rules like you have to sign for your bed at 11 every day or you loose the bed. sure you can get a “pass” and all that but you will see how frustrating getting anything is. its jail mixed with a college dorm i had roommates until i was 30 lol you can do it i lived in flatbush with that pay for 2 years. you’re fine, stop being dramatic and find roommates. look at spare room or roomi how many hours do you work in a week tho. try get some ot if you can, if not, get a pt gig get a roommate and get a 2 bedroom apartment for 2,000 a month (check the bronx) do bartending or serving at a restaurant on the weekends. easy extra 150-400 a night you could probably find a roommate in not the best neighborhoods. you could split a 1br 8-900 with someone. you’re gonna have to work overtime if it’s possible unfortunately i’m dying to find a roommate for my apartment in harlem…$1,150 . they’re out there just keep lookin facebook market place advertises $700-$1000 rooms now that the summer price inflation is blowing over, it’s def possible there you can rent a room in scotch plains nj for $1000. you can pretend to be an illegal immigrate and get free housing, food, mobile phone, healthcare and job assistance? assuming its full time, you should be able to afford something 1000-1100   i was paying that in bed stuy w two roommates and only pay a lil more now in bushwick (for a significantly larger place). tons of options in brooklyn, queens, bronx and jersey in that price range just have to be okay w 2-3 roommates which is normal in nyc. the bronx is the cheapest i have a friend paying 600 on rent w 2 roommates. if your pay ceiling is $22/hr you need to move somewhere more affordable. why stay there.  serious question. i have a spacious 1 bedroom apt for 1500 in bay ridge. my parents pay 1300 for the same in bensonhurst. my friend rents a room in sunset park for $600. you just need to look outside of the same 4 neighborhoods everyone who moves here tries to live in lol. i’m not saying it’s so easy to get one, but the affordable apartments are out there. and they’re often nicer than the “more convenient” ones. i would rather have a longer commute than spend my whole paycheck on rent. 22/hr is enough. broaden the search. the apts are out there. hey chin up! i managed to find a place that was within my budget set a maximum budget and stick to it. also not sure if facebook is even a good place i managed to meet so many scammers including people who i thought i would room with until they ditched me last second. you actually qualify for a housing voucher . try spareroom! and look for neighborhoods that aren’t expensive! you can def find a cool roomie. good luck! i rent a room in a bushwick for $730.  when i first moved here, i was making $15/hour and rented a room for $1200. it was hard, but not impossible.  respectfully, get over yourself. i work with unhoused people. literally all of them tell me, “i was in the shelter and it was so bad i’d rather be on the streets.”  cheap rooms exist. they’re becoming harder to find, but it sounds like you’re not looking in the right places. i make $18 for now and live with my parents until something better comes. it's not easy but it is what it is. i don't want multiple jobs why don’t you live in the bronx? you’ll get smth that’s more affordable and can possibly even save if you play your cards right move to new jersey on a bus route that takes you into manhattan. if you’re willing to travel 1 hour to get to work at least make it worth it.   a lot of my friends and family work for the city and most live in the outer areas and they have decent spaces in your price range. if you have roommates you can find an affordable apartment. i make right around $22 and am doing fine with $1350 rent. only issue is getting the money for security deposit/brokers fee you get definitely get a room, but not an apartment for that salary. when i moved here in 2021, i was making $17 a hour and paying $950 a month for a room. it was rough but do-able $22 not bad 😭 find a  roommate or a studio apartment around 1800 you’ll be able to do it some days u might just be getting by but who isn’t these days 😭😪 where are you looking, and what else are you spending your money on? i make 18.50/hr and usually work around \~30 hours a week. i'm in upper manhattan in a rent stabilized 3 bedroom so my rent is just over 1k. it's half of what i make each month, but i'm still able to get by planning trips and doing fun things without going into debt. move to the bronx ! you can find a room. $22 is really good, a lot of people in nyc don’t make that much. you need to set a budget and you may not like it but look in cheaper areas. i suggest upper manhattan, queens and brooklyn. sorry but you won’t be able to afford a place in east village, les, uws, etc… facebook marketplace rooms in queens by jamaica there are rooms in every borough including manhattan for 1k a month become a substitute teacher for the public schools, no experience needed and pays $211  a day only working from like 8:20am-3pm i have a bedroom available for $225 p/week in manhattan, wash heights. subways and bus lines are steps away. there is also tons of restaurants, supermarkets and stores nearby. if you would like to check it out. i just finished remodeling it and it became available this week.. no offense, it's pretty clear you've never lived in a shelter before. people able to make minimum wage full time dip as quick as they can. you need to look in other neighborhoods and/or give up some amenities and/or be further from public transit. those 3 things will affect the cost of apartments a lot.   for example our 3 bed in bay ridge is $3200. we have in unit laundry, plus a dishwasher, a small shared yard space and are 5 minute walk from the train. split even that’s $1066 for a room which should be doable on ~45k pretax per year. if you’d find more basic apartment that is further from the train, you’d be paying even less. you 100% can find a spot, a room or even roommates i make less then you and i can afford it with having fun still. omfg i the headaches   i once worked for a living ..i made about 30 bucks an hour and had nothing ..literally no way to live ..my rent was 3200 a month for a one bedroom apartment and the rest went to bills.  i went to get free food because i was hungry.  never again.   now i live in subsidized housing  ..i get a disability check for 1600 a month and my rent is 400 ..i have way much more spending money now.  i have a extra 😀1000 after paying for my delivered food and tech  they can take that shit and put it where it belongs but i won’t conform to be a slsve ..the working poor yeah.. there are plenty of homeless working people in nyc.   and plenty of housed non-working people too. 😠  it makes me angry to think that my taxes don’t go to veterans or people who are really trying to get by and make ends meet. apply on nyhousing connect as well. it has lottery apartments from low to high income. worth a shot if you have nothing else to loose a friend of mine whose family lives upstate commutes to the city for work 4 days a week and rents a room monthly on the ground level of a house in a bus-accessible but not subway-accessible part of queens (i think around auburndale or murray hill  $400 a month. by the way, he makes good money and even owns a condo in queens that he rents out. he's just frugal.   you can find a place as long as you're willing to make the commute tradeoff of being not on a train line. i make $21.91 and i spend about $500-$700 each check to stay in a room at an airbnb for two weeks. love this thread lots of helpful info you can find muchhhh cheaper than $1800 for a room. lol this guy said shelter. bahahabaha dude, not all of nyc is that expensive. probably not a popular answer..  but it would be easy to find a job making at least that much in jersey and apartments are half the price here so you could split one for probably $1k each dude, leave new york. i did and now i have a 3br house and land in virginia for less that i paid for 2br apt in brooklyn. why are new yorkers so unwilling to change? you’ve been priced out. just accept it and live a better life. i moved to manhattan (13 years ago, so slightly different times) making $900/month working 55 hours a week. myself, and my approximately 300 coworkers, all made it work somehow. i was lucky enough to get help from my parents, others lived at home, and most had roommates and lived in the outer boroughs.   adjust your expectations, assess what matters the most to you personally. short commute? large bedroom? not too many roommates? my sister and her husband just bought a 1br condo in nyc for 1.7 million so yea this checks out as accurate. just move? i live in texas and whataburger or heb pays about that much. i have a room for rent for $800+ utilities. message me if you are interested to view it all due respect but are you one of those people who thinks living in nyc is only living in manhattan and the expensive bits of brooklyn get roommates why do people decide to live like rats over there is beyond me. move tf out!

56,Remove BROKER's fees for once! ,"every other state just has apartments listed on a website. or signs in the window. why does nyc allow brokers? rad! fuck paying broker’s fees as a tenant. let the landlords pay. the broker is working for the landlord, with only the landlord best interest. how is the tenant the one responsible to pay for it? this is good in thought but landlords would just raise their rents $200-$800 depending on the apartment. before se became the dominant platform for advertising, most apartments were just considered open listings. brokerage firms advertised on websites without showing the address. before a tenant could get an address, they would need to “hire” the tenant’s agent to show them. if this passed, i wouldn’t be surprised to see agent exclusive listings disappear.  my guess is owners will stop asking agents to advertise their listings with addresses shown so tenants won’t be able to “find it themselves”.   does anyone else remember these days? already tried and failed...per the nys supreme court. i think we need to organize and have a tenant's lobby or some sort of major voting bloc to get something like this passed.   landlords and brokers have lobbies that ensure that any bill like will die before it gets passed or even if it does they will use an army of lawyers to find loopholes or get it struck down in the courts. landlords would jack the rent even more to cover this new cost. another solution would be put a cap on what brokers can charge - 1 month's rent, which is far more fair. it makes moving more doable. our growing linkedin group with 4900+ members has a no fee policy so definitely check it out! profiles must be linkedin verified for approval - keeps bots and spam out. tbh, the worst brokers are the ones with broker fees.  i've had some amazing brokers who were no fee.  i'm not sure if they get paid well so that a broker fee is not needed. rents would not go up by 15% after the fee was removed - the fee is preferable to landlords because it creates lack of transparency in price and most consumers anchor on the rent price before doing the calculations of what the net rent would be amortized over the year with the fee.  my guess would be rents would rise ~8% with zero fees which would be a 7% net win for consumers, in addition to making it easier to move without as much cash on hand as a landlord in ma i pay one months broker fee when management finds me tenant. ridiculous to have tenants pay everyone  new yorker should write or type letters and send to their local council members in their district showing support of the ban while it's on the floor right now and a major topic in the news.  if they see their constituency wants this, they'll fight to get it passed if it means reelection.  i'm  pro-banning broker fees.",281,45,neutral,0.4812777042388916,326,i think tenants should write letters to their local council members in their district showing support of the ban while it's on the floor right now and a major topic in the news. i think tenants should write letters to their local council members in their district showing support of the ban while it's on the floor right now and in the news. i'm pro-banning broker fees. i'm pro-banning brokers. i'
57,"15,000 brokers fee! On a rent stabilized building?!","so governer hochul recently called this illegal, and some agents had to pay fees like this back. problem is they never once actually mention where the legal “limit” actually lives, so it’s impossible for you to tell the agent their max acceptable fee is $x.  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-action-against-real-estate-brokerage-firm-charging-excessive-broker   you could pay it, keep full documentation, have everything in writing, then complain to hochuls office and the ags office and hope for the best also, name and shame this asshole. let's all leave them negative google and yelp reviews https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/01/25/city-wide-apartments-paying-260k-after-broker-fee-controversy/  report this broker to leticia james, the nys ag just to be sure, they said $15,000 and not 15%, right? either way, brokers are so gross. i’ve dealt with a very similar situation where the broker knew an apartment was going to be super hot because it was rent stabilized so they charged a 15% fee to “weed out the unserious people”. i can only imagine if the $15k is legit that the landlord is in on it because their profits on a rent stabilized unit are lower. just bring up this article   https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/01/25/city-wide-apartments-paying-260k-after-broker-fee-controversy/# report him, a real estate company recently got fined for doing such unethical shit hey u/thenewyorktimes - might want to take a look at this one! it’s called a key fee. very typical for outstanding rates in areas of high demand. someone will take up the offer if the rent truly is that much lower than market rate. this is because the savings start compounding the longer you stay. landlords are required to renew rent stabilized leases so you can stay for 10 years and save $75k+ on rent over that time, probably much more since market rate grows at much faster rate than stabilized increases. i saw a 1450 rent stabilized apartment not too long ago. broker asked for 45% broker fee. no one took the bait the first time. i said i would do 15%. saw it go back up 2-3 days later. it didn't go back up after that. report them. i once had a broker try to charge me a $10k fee for a rent stabilized unit. i chewed him out, announced the fee to everyone still in line for the open house viewing, and reported him on streeteasy. these brokers are trash.  i later found a rent stabilized unit for a reasonable fee ($2k, the cost of one month’s rent), so you don’t need to pay exorbitant fees to get a rent stabilized apartment! that’s only an extra $1k per month for 1.25 years then it’s back to $1kish forever with minimal increase. you were going to pay $1800 anyway so…..this sounds like an amazing deal if you actually like the apartment. it's a scam.   it's a scam. it's a scam.  you'll pay that $15,000k and a year later you're told that the original rent was the preferential rate and when you sign your new lease they'll charge you the legal rate which will be something like $5k.  you'll refuse and eventually move and they will start the scam all over again.  if you want to know if something is legit you should call. new york state homes and community renewal.  call 311 and ask for the number nail his ass to the wall. you're renting in a one-party consent state.  ""sorry, could you say that broker fee a little louder please so i can hear? $15,000 is that right?"" is this for an apt in the crown heights/prospect heights area? because i just saw a listing on craigslist for a rent stabilized unit ($1800) and in all caps it said there would be an “extremely high brokers fee.” the ad didn’t specify how much so i just passed on it, but i was curious what extremely high meant. i’ve had one ask for that before. told him to go fuck himself. think about the savings though? really just think about the savings if it’s a good building it’s worth it. if you have the cash and want the place, as others have pointed out, the cost will return on the investment.  it’s also probably illegal and the ag seems interested in the case. if i were in your shoes with 15k to spend, i would.  then i’d try to get it back.  once you’re in a stabilized apartment there isn’t much a landlord can do to you, take the ll and broker to court once you have your keys. i'm an agent and that is the shades bs i've ever heard. this is the kind of trash that makes us all look bad. i know of building owners who have their brokers license and do this to increase the revenue on the units. supposedly because it's now so much harder to get the apartments out of stabilization. probably legal, but ridiculous. that said, it may actually be worth it. cost it out. two questions you have to ask:  1. what's the apartment worth, based on location, size, features, etc. gotta be more than $1,000 a month, but how much more? do your research (quickly) and be conservative.   2. how long do you expect to be living in the apartment? you can never be 100% sure, but be honest and (again) conservative in your estimates.  multiply the two numbers and give yourself a margin for error. if you’re saving $500 a month, the fee will pay for itself in less than three years.  insist on a receipt for the fee and refuse to pay cash; you'll want the cancelled check. also, once you have a lease and are moved in, there's nothing to stop you from reaching out to the ag's office or other governmental entity. this reminded me of this nora ephron story about how she paid $24,000 to a previous tenant so she could move into a rent-controlled building. a long time ago, but still. moving on, a love story https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/06/05/moving-on-nora-ephron lmao nah that’s illegal af post the listing i’ll take it i will take it if you don't want if this building is in manhattan — the city probably charges the owner $1,000 month in re taxes.   regardless of whether the apartment is vacant or full. if the apartment is nice and renovated and great location, i would pay $15k one time fee to pay only $1k a month. it pays off after 15 months. the maximum fee he’s legally allowed to charge is 15% of the annual rent which would be 1800 . you’re better off finding another apartment imagine paying a 19k broker fee to anyone. could never be me. but people have the power to stop these things but the allure of ny is just that strong i guess? hmm, it’s legal, which means nyc is just as windy as chicago. however, have you tried contacting the owner of the apartment directly? you could offer them 2 months rent to cut their extortionist broker out. if the broker has some very close ties with them though, you’re just going to have to find somewhere else.  to everyone saying it’s still a good deal, you’re entitled to that opinion, even if brokers objectively just add friction to the efficient market. this is illegal btw [deleted] so ny is turning into japan, instead of “key money”, it’s “broker fee”. it’s legit. they do that because in the long run it’s a great deal for you honestly !!! it’s just hard coming up with that type of money without good credit, savings, or luck. good luck in all your endeavors 🫶🏾 let’s say the market price for an apartment like the one you saw is 3.6k then you’re saving around 2.5k per month which is 30k a year…   obviously i don’t agree with the broker charging a 15k brokers fee (ew) but yes you’d be saving 30k a year by going for this rent stabilised place   alternatively find a new rental stabilised place, if you can that is. if it's rent stabilized apartment, just pay the upfront fee and live there for long time.  unless you move around alot sends me the posting might be interested the bigger issue is that a landlord is forced to rent an apartment at half the market rate. i’d put down the 15k then try to go to legal aid and see if they can help tru to get a settlement to get some back. it’s mostly likely legal though and a rent stabilized apartment in nyc, you’ll make up that 15k with the lower rent. people don’t seem to understand you’re paying 2k below market price. in less than a year you recoup what you lost and more in savings. most rent stabilized are definitely a far cry from luxury especially with a cheapskate landlord who never responds until you 311 their ass multiple times in a row so if you leave when the lease ends you can say bye to those “savings” the i am curious, can you find this agent on https://www.rebny.com/?

Some data ""analysis"".","hey, i feel you. i'm looking for a roommate for a 2 bed, 1 bath. if you're interested, i think it could save us both some money! my dm's are open. its price fixing.  the large property managers would rather have empty units if they can’t get that $200 increase every year.  they need to fine landlords $10k a month for vacant apartments and we will see prices come back to reality. i’m feeling the same way, truly losing my mind. the prices on these absolutely mediocre apartments are absurd.   i just want to switch apartments after 2 years in an area and i feel p stuck w this rental game. applied for one place that was already above budget for us at 3.8k. someone out in an offer for 4.6k. almost 1k more than they asked 🫠🫠🫠 good data gathering.  all self interest aside, it does seem proper fucked and it makes me really curious about what will happen. there must come a point where it simple alters the fabric of society enough that something gives. i just moved to a 2 br 2.5 bathroom with a back yard in a great location in brooklyn for 3k but it took us about 4 months to find it. and the more i read this subreddit the luckier i feel. new york apartment hunting is basically a full time job now if you want to find anything of any value in a decent location that’s why i’m leaving the city. i make over 200k combined with my partner and it’s hardly enough to enjoy what should be basic amenities (w/d in unit, ac, dishwasher) damn i'm sorry. i'm from the nyc area and moved away for college and never came back. i have basically accepted i will never get to live near my family as an adult because i simply will never be able to afford it, unless i live in abject poverty. fortunate to still live in my apartment since the 90s but even $1500 a month is expensive when my parents use to pay $500 a month in 1993 for 3 bed room. 😬😬 i can not let this go should not have come to read this after hearing my coworker talk about how her sister-in-law’s parents bought their daughter a 1br on the ues so she could “get out of a breakup more easily” 🤢 1) make airbnb illegal.  like 100% illegal.  2) rent control the first two or three years of all leases.    problem solved. i’m currently looking in queens and it is just depressing. i’d love to move out of this tiny ass pos studio in astoria but $1800/mo is too “cheap” to step away from. everything else we’re looking at is a minimum of $2200-2400/mo for not much of an upgrade. like… why drop an extra ~$600/mo if it won’t really change things for the better?  maybe it’s time to look deeper into queens, or just say fuck it and move to jersey. either way it’s a mess out there. my 2nd year in nyc and really hard to see a long term future here if i don’t have a household income that’s $200+   amazing city that i didn’t like at first but one of a kinda (in all respects clearly lol) and the broker fees seem to nearly always be 15% now! i lived in ridgewood, and i saw my old unit went up $500 in rent. wasnt rent controlled, but it’s ridiculous it’s insane   periodically look at my old hood in queens and the rents are almost double what they were 15 years ago it is 100% collusion among large landlords pushing prices up using a single third party software that coordinates what everyone is “allowed” to list at.   there are no consumer protections. america is a corporatocracy wasteland. enjoy getting squeezed to the last drop in the name of efficiencies. i know i am. this is why we need to build more housing. supply is too tightly constrained.   we are so focused on affordable housing and not the affordability of housing. affordable housing is for a small subset of the population that definitely needs it. making housing attainable for the middle class comes from building more homes. dare i say have you considered staten island?

  - credit card & digital payment fees  - that city tax we have  - tolls/subways  - cost of phone services and pointless subscriptions. i've been cleaning that up in the last year. 900 😂😂 (i have monstrous student loans) zero, cuz they have mortgages i'm paying 2420 for a 3 bedroom in ridgewood. i moved here during the pandemic, before time out decided it was the #3 coolest neighborhood in the world (ugh, why?) so we definitely got a deal combined income 200,000 renting a 5 bedroom house (laundry full backyard, two car driveway) in queens for 4,000. i miss being in brooklyn but my 4 bedroom duplex (laundry, one parking space, private rooftop) wanted to raise my rent to 4,500. the rent was fine but the house is poorly insulated the utilities are insane. i had less than two months to move and tried to buy a house first but there was nothing move in ready in my budget under 700,000. my current landlord locked in my rent for three years after this i’ll be trying to get a transfer with my job out of state. $450k. pay $3k 2 bedroom $1800 staten island. express bus to midtown under an hour. 30 min to downtown via hov lane. very walkable neighborhood. and we have a backyard. $1875 for my share of a 2b in meatpacking $1850 for 1br in astoria 2.1k in queens for a 2bd and 1ba 1.5k astoria, although outside of the range wife makes the higher end of that, i make on the lower end. we pay 2750 in north brooklyn, but we also have a mortgage upstate. 8.5k in tribeca but (big but) its a 3 bedroom split between 2 people(4250 each) but we airbnb our guest room collectively probably 7-8months out of the year with short term rentals. so on average we probably actually pay 3-3.5 a person a month if you average out the passive income. plus we are both coop owners and we rent out those apts as well so we have rental passive income from those investments not included in the total am referencing here. so 8.5k sounds crazy but not as crazy when you add everything up. splitting a 4k 1br in jersey city with partner (1.3k for my share) 4800 split with my gf for a large 1 bed in greenwich village $3.8k lic, alcove studio, luxury building, sweeping views of manhattan skyline. 3k for a 2bd in sunnyside queens (shared with spouse of similar income) on low end of the range, but $2,500 (total $5,000) 760 sf flex 1 bed into two bed with a roommate, high rise building in midtown. $3k for a 2 br in astoria, parking included. v lucky. $2,150  1br in park slope splitting 3.9k with a roommate for a 1br in a luxury building with all amenities $200k, $2850 for a 1br in bed stuy/clinton hill 7k midtown east $900 / mo for a room in a 3 bd $3.6k for a 2b2b in lic elevator building less than 10 years old 2800 for my half of a (luxury) one bedroom with my husband $2500 2br + office + private backyard in queens 3k in soho, subsidized housing from work. combined household of 300k\~  wife and i pay 3,800 for a house rental .

62,"LPT: Apartment prices that end with random numbers are more likely to be rent stabilized (e.g., $2,986, $3,526)","either net effective rent or rs, yep. not always, but def more likely there is really no reason a broker wouldn't advertise stabilization unless they weren't renting at the stabilized rent. this is a good tip for scanning streeteasy without reading the ads, but i suspect the stabilization is almost always in the description, as it's a huge selling point.  the only reason not to disclose the status is if they're cheating on the rent, in which case it'd be a round number anyway. my apartment is technically stabilized but the lease is set to some ridiculous amount like 10,000/month with preferential rent of 3.5k. so when they raise every yr they take the percentage from the 10k instead of 3.5k additionally, if your rent stabilized apartment has rent that is a strangely neat number you might be getting overcharged & should order ur units rental history [deleted] nice. always kind of wondered when i saw those kinds of listings.",269,15,neutral,0.5288825631141663,284,if u're getting overcharged..... ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
63,Found Wyze Camera IN my bedroom ,"sounds like a [wyze climate sensor](https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-climate-sensor based on op's description.  they don't make any cameras that are 1""x1""  the ll should have provided notice to install it, but that's a different story.  thread is locked. thank you to u/grandzu for bringing sense to this thread. this is nightmare fuel call the cops for sure on some nerd shit you should've kept it on and used a networking tool to determine where that connection is being hosted from     i'd inform the police/start looking for new apartments you sure it's not a wyze climate sensor for temperature and heat readings? report and sue change your locks immediately. do not ask permission, do not inform your landlord or super, and do not give anyone a copy of your key. then go to the cops. get your own camera and have it face your door to see if anyone has been entering 1. put a piece of nontransparent tape over the lens. it must be powered by a battery, and can continue to send signals until its battery dies.  i see some wyze cameras can also record sound, so stick it someplace where it can't hear anything (a cooler? your fridge? wrapped in bubble wrap and set in a little carboard box?)  2. as others have said, change your locks immediately. lock all windows.   3. document everything: don't peel off the velcro. photograph it. write out an account of exactly how you discovered the camera and email it to yourself to give it a digital time-stamp.   4. take it to police as others have mentioned. but be prepared for the nypd to refuse to take this as a criminal complaint, especially once they hear the word ""landlord."" i'm only half kidding when i say that if a landlord stabs a tenant, the nypd would tell you that it is a landlord-tenant matter you will have to deal with in civil court. but there is always a chance they may take it seriously.   5. if not, contact the queens da's office, ideally first in writing. i don't know if this falls under the purview of the special victims bureau, but it might. if not, they might tell you who to speak to. does the device have an actual camera or lens on it? look online to see what the heat sensor looks like. hopefully it’s just the heat sensor. people on here will have you freaking out & blaming people without asking the right questions first. good luck! heat sensors are common in nyc in order to balance internal apt temps in winter. i’m pretty sure it’s that. yea take it to the police and tell them what happened call the police immediately. really not trying to add stress, but it’s worth pointing out that the camera must be battery powered if it was simply attached via velcro and isn’t plugged in, meaning it needs to be charged periodically. call the cops and find somewhere else to stay asap. while, i think they might be right saying you should have not removed it. who is not(!!!!!) going to do exactly what she did? especially if female. and do you really think a jury is going to hold that against her??? there has to be a serial number on it, that number can be hunted down. if you can't get help from the cops, find a lawyer or pi and see if they won't help. might even go to city u and ask a student. document everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i mean everything!!!!!!!!!!!!! everyone you talk to, pictures, detailed discrimination of the who,what, where, how,,, everything. sooner or later this will come in extremely handy. also see if you are on the web. i am so very sorry, good luck. info - are you sure it’s a camera? i own wyze cameras - they are too heavy to velcro to the wall. this sounds much more like a sensor.  can you post a picture of it here? or just google wyze sensor and see if that’s what you have (they make climate sensors and motion sensors) update yet? you got this this happened in greenpoint not too long ago! https://greenpointers.com/2021/07/22/greenpoint-man-secretly-records-female-roommates-in-shower/ yeesh. on that note, can anyone recommend a handheld detector they’ve used with some success? i know about the phone tricks and apps and such, but would rather something a little more reliable designed for this purpose. op, call a sexual violence support hotline like rainn to get a sense of what your full range of options are. as a dv-certified social worker, i would never recommend a client go to the cops until they have a solid understanding of the potential risks vs benefits— most survivors are (re)traumatized by their experience of reporting. a lot of people in this thread must have been watching a lot of law & order suv to have this much faith in the nypd, but i want to make sure you make an informed choice here. i’m so sorry you’ve experienced this and hope you get all the support you need. the sd card will have intact fingerprints for sure. call the police. wow she should’ve never removed the camera instead call police detectives sounds like a law suit and free rent to me everyone talking about technical hacking shit is wrong. investigating is not your job and anything you do will fuck up a real investigation.  remove device.  put in a box. put box in a box. take box in a box to local police precinct.  anyone with keys to your apartment, or has borrowed keys, even for short term work, is a suspect.  edit: technical shit will only help you locate the person responsible. this is not something you want to do. you do not know what a person who does this will do when confronted, scared, or if they believe they are almost caught. you are not safe in your apartment until this is addressed by real authorities.  i make camera systems like this professionally. and i am 100% on the acab train.  but they are the only option that might resolve this situation in a way you find acceptable and without risk of serious consequences. call the police immediately call the cops. sue landlord. look for another space. 100% time to spend $300 to ensure your safety.   buy three wyze cameras for yourself and put them in every room. pay $5/month for their cloud footage storage and start collecting evidence.  file a police report with a detailed written statement. note times and dates next to each detail. note action you will take to collect evidence. note how you are feeling about the whole situation. nothing may happen now, but getting this on the record may help you later if you report again.  if you can, get some mace/tasers (whatever is legal) to protect yourself in your home and while you are out. whoever placed that camera there is unlikely to have done it randomly. you might have a stalker.  share your location indefinitely with three trusted friends or family members and tell them what happened. tell them where you are going and when you are going to return for the next few months. consider regular check ins throughout the day.  if you are wealthy, you may want to hire a private investigator as well.  i’m sorry this happened to you. i’m sure you feel violated and unsafe right now. be safe. nypd  why is this a question i believe 311 is who to call. you don’t know there aren’t more. report to the cops, call a lawyer. why post on reddit instead of going to the police? you definitely do not have the technical know-how to figure this out yourself.  also, how is the camera powered?",270,59,negative,0.5031664967536926,329,?-room-video--room-video--room-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video-video
64,There is hope!! ,"congratulations what site did you use for a rent stabilized place? my first place in nyc 10 years ago was a room with 4 other roommates in a walk up. fast forward 10 years and my dream apartment (also rent stabilized) is a 5th floor walk-up, no air conditioning, no dishwasher, no laundry in the building. but it’s mine, it’s cozy, and i can afford a little slice of the city on my own in my favorite neighborhood. and i absolutely love it! we all have different goals :) congratulations!! how did you find this? would love some tips! hope this good luck spreads to more of us! how much and where? stabilized does not exactly mean cheap, how much are you paying? i just got a 2 bed 1 bath, basement and yard, $1780... it's happening!! things are looking better ❤️ so happy for you. this sub is, understandably, doom and gloom most of the time, so it's great to hear about a win ❤️ looks like it might be [this place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nycapartments/s/95e3c0nk51) congrats!! love to hear this. wow can’t wait to be on the other side like you and other lucky ones! this feels absolutely horrible looking and constantly refreshing streeteasy. congrats!! they definitely exist, plenty in my building that fit all the criteria you mention including rent stabilized. but they are $6k for 1br lol. this made me smile! go you! enjoy 😀 i have similar specs including rent stab and also found on street easy! if it’s that new to have those amenities, it’s likely only rent stabilized temporarily based on a tax abatement. yeah, it’s a long time, but it’s not permanent. congrats!  where are you in the town? around 116th? can i come over? 😭 this no a/c is killing me central air and w/d in unit? no way less than $7k/mo right? where in nyc? bragging that they can afford a $5k apartment. how is it a deal? just curious. glad you found what you wanted! section 8? 3k a month or more that you are pissing away and will never see again. great deal!",260,79,positive,0.929806351661682,339,? i would say that is a lot of money to pay for a place you will never see again. i would say that is a lot of money to pay for a place you will never see again. i would say congrats! i am in the same boat! congrats! i am in the same boat! ! congrats! congrats forward!.
65,How is it to live in a 30th+ floor?,"it’s fine but waiting for the elevators/having people keep stopping them on lower floors is a bit annoying. otherwise, totally great. champagne problem. i’d see how many elevators they have in the building to access your floor. say they have 2 elevators, one breaks down. average 10 units per floor, that’s ~300 apartments, i’d say at least 4-600 residents. could be a bit of a snafu getting up and down & waiting for an elevator in that very specific situation. when it is windy, you might feel it sway. that terrified me when i used to go to a friend’s place. elevator wait time, off chance power goes out (or fire drills) and you need to walk the stairs, if you get a puppy potty training could cause issues lol i live on the 45th floor in lic and my gf loves it. great view to the city and great sunlight.  downside is waiting for elevators. but it isn’t bad at all i lived on the 53rd floor of a building for a few years. view was awesome and it was super quiet. also enjoyed having a doorman and access to 24/7 maintenance. that said, waiting for elevators and trying to move furniture in/out was a nightmare. also, i think you lose a bit of the authenticity of living in the city in these types of buildings but the amenities might make up for that! there is no downside, unless the elevator stops working.  that hasn’t happened for me, thankfully.  lived on the 61st floor, then the 30th floor. ex boyfriend lived on the 32nd floor, biggest downside was waiting for elevators and one time somebody set off the fire alarm (idiot teens smoking in the hallway!) and we had to walk down all the stairs in the middle of the night. like others have mentioned, elevator wait can be annoying. if there’s a power outage or elevators go down, can be rough going (in my building there was a fire on a lower floor and when the fd came to put it out, they dumped so much water it flooded all the elevator shafts and they all broke.) also, this is very specific but if you have cats, they have less to look at the higher up you are and get bored, lol.  if the light is amazing, make sure you have amazing window shades.  :) otherwise, enjoy the view! i was living on the 27th floor when hurricane sandy hit and knocked out power to my building for a week so leaving/coming home was rough. i joked that i lived in a 27 floor walk-up. i grew up on the 30th floor in uptown nyc. amazing views but the most annoying thing is waiting for the elevator. it didn’t happen too often but i remember having to walk up the stairs during that historic blackout in the 2000s. on the 30th, so i just made the cut...  - great view that visitors will spectacle at - sunrise/sunset is usually a gorgeous cinema - heavy rain looks crazy. sometimes it feels like you're in the clouds - significantly less traffic noise, but you still hear sirens/loud motors - hard to do window cleaning  - feel like a boss as others step off the elevator and you keep going up no downsides if your elevator wait isn’t long, my apartment has a fast elevator and is a luxury condo so never busy and max wait for elevator is 30 seconds and takes another 30 to get my (40s floor) apartment i lived on 29 and i liked it a lot. but i lived in chelsea so i thought i was going to have views for days, but instead i just looked into my neighbors apartments.   downside was elevators, especially on weekends, forgetting your water when you go to the gym. real simple stuff it's incredibly annoying waiting for the elevator, it used to take me 5 minutes just to get out of the building.   also i had to deal with car and siren noises a lot because it guess it bounces towards the building from many angles lived on 38 for the first five years i was married.  we had an amazing view, which i only noticed when guests came over.  and it was tough the times we had to walk up the stairs (for several days after 9/11 and during that big east coast blackout in… 2003?). but no complaints otherwise.  our elevator was super fast.  i got to 38 faster than it takes to get from the basement to the third floor at my job in a store. if you're at the very top floor be prepared to have a lot of stops before going up..  if you do not have blackout curtains, you will get a nice beam in your face  building sways  food delivery takes longer to get up even when the app says he is there, he isnt  weird thing is that noise from street level tends to echo when traveling up so if you think you'll be safe from city noise pollution, think again  highest floor means you'll also have to deal with rooftop/lounge goers if your building has one of those on the top floors, which means more activity if your floor has amenities on it i loved it, but two things. things to look out for; new built buildings having secretly shitty construction, especially if you notice/have allergies or anything.   and negative air pressure; if you start noticing a lot of dust, smells, or that air blows into your apartment from the outside, you might need to fix your air pressure to get a positive pressure, maybe sealing up windows or your doorway (which is good for sound proofing anyway!)   otherwise; enjoy the view!!  otherwise; awesome views! hot amazing in new york as long as you have a view. i felt like i was in a dream every time i went to sleep in my first apartment here. there were zero downsides for me. if you live somewhere with a good elevator system, you’ll be good. it’s generally much quieter do you’ll sleep better i used to live on the 27th floor and like you said the view and light are amazing. one pro that i haven’t seen anyone mention yet is the noise (or lack there of). when you get to a certain level, you wont hear the constant honking and hustle and bustle you normally hear. with that being said, the wind can be loud at times, but the only real downside i had living that high up was the elevator(s) breaking down. there was always at least one elevator working except for one instance they all stopped working. i tried to just not leave my apartment until the elevator was fixed but it took 2 days to finally get back up and running. walking up and down 27 floors was miserable. aside from that, living high up was great. i live on the 38th floor right now and love it. the views are incredible, great sunlight, and my building has more than enough elevators. never had a problem. it’s great until hurricane sandy comes through. highest i have ever lived was the 21st floor. elevator waiting was annoying. you also feel slight building sway on windy days as well as a sort of stuffy head feeling on days where there is thick low fog. there hasn’t been any downsides yet. watch ace ventura pet detective before signing the lease good views and good sunsets but wifi and cell phone service ughhhhhh make sure you can climb up/down that many stairs in case of blackout or fire. doesn’t have to be at a run but if you should be able to do briskly. would not live that high with a child under 12 or pet weighing more than 25 pounds.   i have lived on the 29th floor and 41st floor when there was a fire in the building and had to evacuate by stairs. i lived on 32nd floor during a blackout. lived on 6th floor (moved within same building to a lower floor) after i had a kid. i currently live on the 20th floor of a 22 story building. the elevator traffic is unreal, everyone also wants to always have their own so will almost always hit close door (at least in my building) and we have 4 elevators. while the view and daylight is spectacular i’ve definitely missed a couple buses/trains that run infrequently because of it, but there’s only one line near me your odds of dying from a heart attack go way up after a certain floor due to response time. i think it's like the 15th floor. does anyone ever get their allergies to flare up once the fall and winter starts to kick in?  for myself, the moment the humidity drops, i end up getting an insane amount of congestion.  but during the summer when the humidity is up, everything is all normal think of 9/11. that should give you pause. in the event of an emergency you should know physically what your exit plan is. don’t do it! i lived on the tenth floor of a building and once we had a fire in the building. i was not a happy camper going down all those steps one of my friends in my old building i grew up in was on a floor above 30th, i was at his place almost every day.  the view was nice until more skyscrapers were built, now the view sucks.  oh, pro tip, for the elevators, press up and down. smoggy possessive mourn degree aromatic somber tap safe far-flung fanatical   *this post was mass deleted and anonymized with [redact](https://redact.dev)* have you been paying attention to the horror show of over developed areas of downtown brookly and midtown? dont ever do it. please elevators if they are not all working, we used to to wait 10 minutes just to get home from the lobby when 20% of the elevators were out of service. i’m on the top floor of my building.  there are 4 elevators that are fast enough and even though i’m right below the roof deck, i have never heard noise from up there.  my only downside is that it is hot as soon as the heat turns on- i have to open my bedroom windows at night, and then it’s all cold, very dry air (but still better than the blasting heat).  the building won’t turn it down because the tenants on the low floors don’t get as much heat. windy i always loved high floor living when i was able. there hardly any downside at all except as people mentioned - the off chance all the elevators go out.  never happened to me. i was on the 29th. it look about a year, maybe less to get used to it (brain felt it sway a tad here and there), but not bad. and great after that. fast elevators (that close doors relatively quickly) too. i loved it! 10/10 would do again i had an ex that lived on the 40 something floor of her building and i would legit shit my pants getting in that elevator no downsides. no bugs, quiet, amazing view, chicks like it  there is a reason they cost more not much different than living on the 29th floor. depending on the building, it's amazing! i lived on the 35th floor of a converted prewar in financial district with my boyfriend at the time. absolutely loved it. it had thick window ledges and the windows started at waist height, so i was never scared to look out or down and see the world going on below. it was like a dream waking up in a cloud on foggy days, and we had incredible sunset views in the spring/fall. there were 4 elevators in total; 2 for the highest floors. yes it was inconvenient when one was out of service, but mostly it was just fine.   another advantage of living on a higher floor is that most problems happen on lower floors. we never had cockroaches, water leaks, nothing like what affected the floors way closer to the ground from time to time. we also had to run our heat way less, the trade off being yeah it was really warm in the summer, but you're mostly out during the day anyway right? so it wasn't that big of a deal.  he was living in a new all-glass skyscraper when we met, and it used to scare me being up high with floor to ceiling windows in a building that swayed with not many other tall buildings around it. i get that they are designed to sway but as a person with a fear of heights...no thanks. i always felt very safe in the apartment we shared downtown. the water pressure was also crappy in his high apartment, whereas that was never our problem in our financial district place. when elevators are down you're in for a bad day. some people get vertigo when looking out i guess. some buildings have some swaying at upper floor (totally normal, but it scares some people). 34th floor isn't high enough for significant sway though.     to me in general it's just straight win, if only because of the significant drop in street noise levels.  though you get to learn just how loud toddlers can be when you hear them clearing screaming from the street and you're on an upper floor, lol. during rush hour, when i lived on the 44th floor of a building i had to add 5 minutes to my commute time. as everyone has said, the main downside risk is elevators. some buildings have plenty, others do not. elevators will break, and also elevators are often reserved for move in/move outs, so if your building only has three elevators, for example, that leaves one working at times. so just thinking through that. i would try to get a building with at least four elevators. when you are that high up stairs are not an option even in a pinch. it can be frustrating to not know how long it'll take to actually leave the building at times, especially if you have an appointment, etc. don’t try to move furniture up the stairs sometimes you can feel the sway of the building that high. i lived on the west coast for awhile and one of my apartments was 30+ and i could feel it sway in heavy winds and even scarier earthquakes. i know they are meant to do that for safety reasons but holy shit was it scary. usually there are express elevators in buildings like that. my building has express elevators and regular ones. i lived on the 32nd floor of a luxury building in midtown east and had the most fantastic view of the city and regularly hosted insane parties with some known djs during my time there and it was wild. one of the most memorable views was when low clouds/fog rolled in and my balcony was above the cloud/fog line and it was like living in an alternate world with the empire state building and world trade piercing through the ground.   downsides though… the elevator broke exactly twice during my 4 years in that building. once while in my apartment and i opted to walk down the stairs to go about my day and the second time i came home to a broken elevator and decided to go back out and wait out the repairs with friends. the elevator lines also got pretty lengthy during peak hours so going up was sometimes a pain but going down was usually fine since i’d be one of the first people on in an empty or relatively empty elevator which would fill up as it made its way to the lobby. ears pop everytime you go above the 20th. the stairs can be tough i’m looking at a high rise too. right now i live in suburbia. my question is how can i get all of my nice furniture up there wo anything getting damaged i'd say if you were ever considering having pets, maybe not living so high up. especially in their older years when bladders fail sometimes. small talk forever sucks with a dog but otherwise chill my fire anxiety could never.  ladders go up to the 7th maybe 8th floor.  34 is too high. i live on 40 in midtown and it’s fantastic. the glass in our building is soundproof so it’s extremely quiet. the only downsides are sometimes (but rarely) local elevator stops in the mornings and a tiny bit of sway when it’s really windy. views are amazing and watching the weather is really cool. light is great. there won’t be much noise and the view and light really will be showstopping, however you may feel it sway and if there is only one elevator and it breaks… that won’t be any good you are screwed if your elevators ever go out. if you have pets that like staring out the window, it may not be ideal either. but otherwise, it is pretty contingent on the unit and floorplan itself imo. i lived on the 21st floor, so not as high, but i never left my apartment because it was such a task to leave. you pay less for warmth, because heat rises. no rats or cockroaches. no street noise. sometimes you can be above the fog and the view is magical. if a fire alarm happens the elevators stop working i hate elevators but love the view from skyscrapers so it’s tough. love it- main thing is elevators. make sure your windows don’t open when there’s high speed winds. and be careful with pets if you open your windows. lived on 36th floor for a year in downtown brooklyn. loved it except for three things:  1. elevators were a pain in the ass. if one went down or just during busy times of day you could expect a 5-10 minute wait.  2. took forever to get hot water especially during high demand times (weekday mornings)  3. when you’re that high up you actually hear the ambient city noise a lot more. it’s like a consistent hum in the background. running errands will be a pain. don’t forget anything! building sway sobers you up. waiting for elevators; walking down the stairs in the event of an emergency/fire alarm/broken elevators i am convinced you are talking about my building…i live on the 34th floor and one of our neighbors was recently evicted. east side, near the water? idk either, lets make a party in your new apt. i always get nervous since 9/11 because the fire engine ladders don’t go past the 10th floor or so iirc. also at those heights you definitely feel the wind during every major storm. depending on the building, some of the skinnier buildings in nyc that are that tall will make horrendous creaking noises in windy weather (you can google it), so try to watch out for that delivery is your best friend. it not the 30th floor problem, it’s the 5th floor walk up problem other than impossible to move furniture & astoundingly long elevator wait times nothing comes to mind really. elevators. my building has 4 and one time i waited 5 whole minutes. but what can ya do amazing views, light and quiet are nice, inconvenient waiting for elevators, awful awful awful when elevators are down or there’s something like a fire alarm and you need to take stairs. i live on the 44th floor. the elevator situation isn’t too bad. it’s nice getting on first on the way down as the elevator can fill up. the only other thing is when it’s super windy, you notice. it’s cool when it’s foggy and it’s completely white outside of my windows. no major complaints at all. lots of problems with temperature regulation due to the amount of sunlight and nothing natural to block it. i don’t even like waiting for the lift in my 6 story apartment drier air: dry skin and chapped lips is a down side. storms are a bit harrowing lived on the 28th floor for 2 years, nothing better than looking out over the city at sunset downsizes is an apt word. i’m envisioning one of those bamboo stick-esque narrow lines they call buildings now. like 500 floors of 250 square foot studios. cant speak for apartments, but in my office building we are on the 40th floor and can feel the building rocking back and forth in the wind.   you never get used to it. its kind of awful. if the building has a fair amount of elevators then i don’t think there is any serious downside. you have good views, good sunlight and peace. it’s worth it. grocery hauls not in nyc, but live on a 35th (out of 44 floor) building. 6 elevators 3 go to floors 1-25 and the other 3 only go to floors 26 and up… so it helps with elevator time!  only thing, imo, is it’s annoying when you leave something in your car and have to go back down for it. but it’s such a non issue that i wouldn’t rage quit living in a high rise over it. i lived in river plaza in chicago for years on one of the upper floors. the bad things about that? mainly the long elevator ride puts you at risk of a lot of shit.  on the long elevator ride up, it gives you time to meet a woman who just moved in. she's from bermuda and knows no one in town.  those long elevator rides give you and your now gf time to make out.  those long elevator rides while you and your soon to be ex have to calm down from fighting as more people get in the elevator.  on the way up to the apartment after a night out and coming home empty handed, elevator stops and two very sultry women get on looking for a party.  being on one of the top floors, means more odds of bad timing. elevator stops on ex's floor and she gets on with her parents while you are just barely able to stand being so hung over.  on the plus side, it gives you plenty of time to clean up after getting the heads up call from the doorman whom you tip very well that the police are on their way. i think the best thing about living above a certain floor in nyc is that all the street noise filters out and you can enjoy the peace and quiet.  not sure exactly how high it starts but it being pretty quiet when i lived on the 20th floor in a high rise",263,162,positive,0.4332263767719269,425,"i had to walk up the stairs a few times, but it was worth it. we lived on 38 for the first five years of my marriage. it was great, but we had to walk up the stairs a few times. we had a doorman and 24/7 maintenance. but no complaints otherwise. i live on 38. it's a great view, but i have to say the elevators are a pain. i live on 38."

73,Big East Village Bedroom ($2.3k/month) // Available April 1st,"how can the apartment be that much money and be rent controlled? it wouldn't be that much even if it was stabilized... if this is a rent stabilized apartment the roommate should be paying a proportionate amount of rent.  are you saying that the rent is $4000 plus for apartment?  “in a rent stabilized apartment, the rent collected from the roommate cannot exceed their proportionate share of the apartment. for example, one tenant named on a lease can take in one roommate and the roommate can be charged no more than half of the rent charged to the prime tenant. the roommate can be advised to file a complaint of rent overcharge with dhcr if they were charged in excess of that proportionate share.  in a rent controlled apartment, a roommate may not be charged an amount of rent that is in excess of the legal rent for the apartment. any determination of a rent overcharge is under the jurisdiction of the civil court.”  https://hcr.ny.gov/rent-increases-and-rent-overcharge love the place.  what are in those boxes on top of the kitchen cabinets lol >i know the east village isn't quite williamsburg/greenpoint   ...you can't be serious just here to say your rug game is strong comment only, but what a sick apartment. if it’s been passed down from friend to friend, you might be paying rent for the whole apt with that amount.    this is a nice apartment, but i wouldn’t want a work from home roommate for that amount. that oven placement is ridiculous and should bring the rent down by at least 1k beautiful place, love the color scheme big east village bedroom available april 1st!  my roommate just bought a place in brooklyn and is moving out in april - so his room is now up for grabs. the apartment has been passed down from friend to friend over the years. it's a fantastic bang for your buck in prime east village. all my friends say this is their favorite apartment they've been to in the city.  i'm 27 and working in consumer goods. in the office three days per week and work from home the rest. if you're interested, shoot me a note about yourself and we'll set up time for you to swing by and check the place out. my instagram is u/stevenpetrillo.  over the past few years i've found roommates through facebook rather than just living with my existing friends and it's worked out great. happy to live with any kind of person as long as you're cool!  **address**: 234 e 4th st (east village)  **bedroom rent**: $2.3k/month  **lease terms:** april 1st move in. can go month to month or join the lease. $2300 is kinda steep for just rending a bedroom, but the apartment is gorgeous and looks really big. i'm obsessed with the green tile in the bathroom! gorgeous place! would you accept someone with pets? if you feel like tying the living room together (which imo is nearly perfect), i suggest swapping the contractor grade boob lamp with something that has more character. can be swapped back easily at move out. holy crap, is that what places are going for now? i pay $2.3k a month for an entire one bedroom in park slope that comes with a balcony, storage unit and rooftop access. sent a dm! i'm not seeing a refrigerator. is that your kitty? :3 they’re trying to make big east village a neighborhood now?

74,Is this ok? ,"first, i’m sorry you’re dealing with this. second, in a largely non-black neighborhood—and especially if it’s a small, local landlord—i wouldn’t doubt that the owner is trying to find some kind of plausible deniability for not renting to you because of your race. if they had another similarly or better-qualified applicant simultaneous to you, they’d just take that person because then there’s almost no chance at proving anything discriminatory. that they keep producing new hoops for you to jump through after you’ve met all of the requirements with no problem suggests (at least to me) that they’re searching for plausible non-racist reasons to disqualify you so they can go back to looking for a new tenant while lowering their risk of getting sued.   i’ve never once heard of a landlord expecting you to have 3x the rent in a bank account for three months prior to renting. nothing to say except this sucks and i'm sorry you're having to deal with it 😥 if i were your broker i'd be pushing back. hard. this seems extreme to me. it’s just about savings. i’ve never been able to qualify without at least $15k in the bank and that was 13 years ago. they will be more comfortable with more savings in the bank for a rainy day or god forbid layoffs. i have seen landlords who need a minimum of $10k, $20k just to feel comfortable in this market. i would not jump to the race thing. it’s a competitive market and a $ thing. i had almost $1 million in my bank account and got denied 12 applications for not having the 3x amount in income for three months since i had just gotten a new job. i had 760 credit. i only applied to $2000/month apts. every application wanted to see pay stubs *and* my bank statements. it was a complete nightmare and i felt like it was a miracle i got an apt 4 days before my lease ended. an absolute nightmare i’m pretty sure it aged me about 10 years! do you know someone else that could express an interest in it and see what they are told? this would be the first step in proving discrimination. they shouldn’t just get away with that. they tried this with my foreign sounding asian last name for sure. 810+ credit score, perfect record, i had brokerage balance letters showing a net worth of at least $200k (not just snapshots, but letters that proved the average balance over the last year was above that) and they still asked for 2 months of checking account statements. showed those, then they asked for tax forms. showed those, then they asked for savings account statements…  like, bitch, my time is literally worth more than yours and i can buy your apartment (but i don’t make a habit out of buying money pits). if we go to court, i have just as much ammunition as you, so let’s not play games. you stand to lose a lot more than a month’s rent with me as your enemy. i’ve never heard of a proof of funds for an apartment. they usually want to see you have money in the bank, but i’ve never had someone say you needed x amount in your statement. sounds crazy. leave a review for them! i once read an article about a black woman who got her white friend to do the in-person stuff but used her real name, banking, etc. to get a home. i hope you won’t need to do that, but it was a good article. i agree this is extremely fishy and i’d be reporting it what can you do? have a white friend stand in for you and apply again with all the same information. when you get approved document everything and go ahead and file a lawsuit for discrimination.   if you still wanna actually live there, then go ahead and move in if they approve the ""white"" application. i'm an nyc real estate broker. while i've heard of all kinds of asset qualifications for purchases, never for rentals. i've only heard of income requirements for rentals. while landlords can have whatever financial qualifications they like, this sounds fishy to me. here are a couple organizations that help nyc renters who believe they may the the victims of race-based housing discrimination: [nyc commission on human rights](https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/index.page), [fair housing justice center. ](https://fairhousingjustice.org/)these sorts of organizations move slowly, but they do move. that’s terrible for a $2k apt ?? i didn’t go through anything like that for a luxury apt. 🤦‍♀️ goodluck did trump’s father own the building? having similar experiences and i’m also a black femme. i’ve been searching/applying since may. it seems a lot of them are eager to rent to people who don’t even know how to pronounce houston or halsey.  solidarity, we will find something ❤️ crazy! all i can think of is to ask if you are self-employed? if you are, they may prefer to get a renter who is salaried, since self-employed income can change dramatically from year to year. maybe they had issues with a self-employed tenant, so they are going wild requiring all sorts of proofs of funds. anyway, this is still bonkers! real estate broker in nyc here, and this is honestly unacceptable. it’s unfortunate that this has been your experience. lived in queens, worked in real estate in brooklyn, this is absolutely weird as shit i learned that a while back before i finally got a better apartment situation. i’m asian (spanish looking though) and my bf was black (light skinned) and met all the  requirements. income credit references etc. but we still had a terrible time looking back then. (was willing to provide an added guarantor too who owned her house and had a million worth of assets (she is asian) at least 3 of them stalled our application and we just figured the owners of the buildings/landlords were specifically handpicking the demographics of the building. unfortunately it is true/traumatic.    i say go for something else if that’s how the vibe is from the get go, i dont see it get any better. they just wanted the fees they can collect and not give back. you kinda got hustled. i’m so sorry this is happening to you. i’m guessing that you have all of this in writing. please reach out to the state ag’s office, or contact a lawyer so they can do so on your behalf. this is not acceptable and i’m so sorry you have to deal with this. fu** racists no point in contacting management directly. you’ll burn that bridge immediately when the agent didn’t do anything wrong. 6-12 months rent in liquid savings is a requirement for most places, you just were never qualified in the first place and the agent did their best to work with your situation but yeah, you didnt get lucky on this one. nothing to do with your race. i’m a broker, and often it makes landlords uncomfy if they feel like you’re going to pay first / security or whatever move in expenses and have not much left . that— and it’s not them asking for more things to create hoops for you to jump through. it’s very likely the broker sent your info and the landlord was like i’m not comfy with this so the broker is trying to gather as much info as possible to make them comfortable. i’ve done it many times — sometimes more documentation (even things not typically required) can help push an iffy file into getting approved. this is how gentrification works. they only want rich people. little by little the neighborhood gets richer and richer until anyone who's not rich can't afford to live there damn if those were my rules i’d be fucked [removed] is it too late to say you went on vacation or something and that's why it's a bit less that time?? cause that's crazy i had similar nonsense happening when i first moved to nyc, ended up solving it by giving them 3 months rent as a deposit. i’m so sorry you’re going through this :( you sound like the perfect tenant! wishing you all the best please report this situation to any of these agencies. my husband is african american and we have had very similar situations happen to us. good luck! in new york city, you can report housing discrimination to several agencies:  1. **new york city commission on human rights (cchr)**: you can file a complaint online, by mail, or in person. more information is available on their [website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/index.page).  2. **new york state division of human rights (dhr)**: you can file a complaint online, by mail, or in person. visit their [website](https://dhr.ny.gov/) for more details.  3. **u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud)**: you can file a complaint online, by mail, or by phone. their website is [here](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/complaint-process).  4. **legal aid society**: they provide free legal assistance and can help you with the process. their [website](https://www.legalaidnyc.org/) has more information.  each of these organizations can assist you in addressing and resolving issues related to housing discrimination.",236,129,negative,0.6872668862342834,365,"i'm sorry you're dealing with this. i've never heard of landlords asking for 3x the rent in a bank account for three months prior to renting. i'm sure they tried this with my foreign sounding asian last name for sure. i had 810 credit, perfect record, had brokerage balance letters showing a net worth of at least $15k and got denied 12 applications for not having $1 million in the bank for"

78,155 ATTORNEY ST - STAY AWAY,"doing the lords work i lived at 155 attorney and let me tell you, that’s not half of it. i’ve lived in nyc for a long time and between me and my partner we’ve had a dozen different landlords and trillion asset management (yes, the real name of the management company, they’re bond villains) was by far the worst. they were mean, unresponsive, cut every possible corner, raised our rent by an unconscionable amount in the deepest part of the pandemic (that summer when other landlords were *cutting* rents or even just being cool), and were negligent to the point of danger. leaks simply got painted over with no effort to fix the underlying problem, when the fire alarm failed it was ignored, the guy sitting on the weird pipe to the right of the main entrance smoking crack became a regular fixture of the building. the building itself was beautiful but seemed to have been built overnight using the cheapest possible materials - things were falling apart that absolutely shouldn’t for a building so new. i’d sooner move to cleveland than go back. i used to be at 145 attorney, and this tracks. my roommates were friends with some of the folks in 155, and had complaints about the bugs. 145 was pest free (at least from my time living there) so the pest problem isn’t something out of their control. nyc renters usually just accept cockroaches as a part of city-living, but if the building next door can keep their space clean enough that pests aren’t a visible problem, so can your building. imo it's the les so what's the problem, but i get it. who wants that problem. does the building have exterminators visit regularly? i can't see any building in nyc not having a few roaches. a co-worker was just telling me that her neighbors just moved out. they must have had a problem in the apartment because the building contacted her and said they will treat her apartment for the next six weeks  even though she doesn't have a problem. it's really about prevention. the hpd / 311 website should offer more details on the situation it looks so nice from the outside. wow. lol. ops basis....  1. couple disgruntled reviews which included 1 google review amd reviews from some platform i am not signing up for.  lol 1 bad review in nyc apartment is not a red flag.  2. one cockroach in a garbage room on bottom floor. which op was told about.  seriously.     not saying this building could be bad but these reasons are not enough for some fear mongering shame post. maybe stop bitching about it on reddit and take them to court. do a lawsuit.     all of these manhattan trustfund kids don't ever want to rock the boat and sue these landlords. instead, they're all just thankful to be on les over the peasantry.

79,i’d LOVE to pay you a higher broker fee!,"20% is already absurd charging a crazy unusually high fee is not serving your owner who is your client. you are their fiduciary and getting them the best profit and the most reliable tenant is your top job.  asking for 20% and bids up on commission for a regular full term lease is greedy and unprofessional. it's rent stabilized. they are basically saying the offer is going to whoever puts the highest broker fee that meets the financial criteria. it's scummy, but i bet some people will do it. you forget to feed the brokers for a year during covid and now their appetite is insatiable adding more info that it’s a studio in fort greene at 2000 a month. so this broker fee “starts” at $4800 but “you can offer more” 🙄 looool  if we were smart, we'd cap broker fees this feels like an attempt to bypass the governors directive that overcharging for broker fees is illegal. instead of charging an 100% fee they say - you give me the offer 20% is wild! that’s almost 2 1/2 months rent!?! and they will happily accept a little bit more? that’s just crazy! so that is basically saying your broker takes bribes. we live in such a fucked up time. 20% is an absolute fucking joke. what is this person smoking? wtf 20% of annual rent, is that a down payment for the apartment would never deal with an agent who does this. personally, if the first message i get from them has to do with crazy high broker fees and or making you sign forms to view a place they go straight on my blacklist. won’t even bother with them paying $10k for someone to shake hands and do the standard paperwork is crazy jeez remember when they charged you one month  rent as a broker fee.. which is 8.33% these greedy pricks want a minimum 2 1/2 months fee @ 20% 😬 fuck brokers. pass the fare bill now. it’s pretty disgusting.   the amount of broker fee will directly impact the rent. in other words, the existence of unregulated broker fee completely fucks over both landlords and tenants.   and i say this as a founding broker with multiple agents working for me. tipping culture: “suggested gratitude 22/25/30%”. brokers in nyc “hold my beer” the broker fees are just as ridiculous as rent prices these days lololololol it’s 15% of the nerve wtf !? it's greedy but i have heard of people offering double the broker free if the apartment is crazy competitive to get (under value in a desirable neighborhood / rent stabilized, etc) offer to fight this guy wtf??  wow, that's wild.  shit, i remember when they requested 10% of the yearly rent.  20% or you could offer more?  did they have a tip jar?  shameless. reminds me of when i bought a home (was in mass at the time) and the agent was like, ""our parent company has an official fee of 5%, but we recommend 6%. it's optional, but i'm allowed to ask and it would be nice if you as the buyer shelled the extra 1%.  we didn't. if the place is good you can stay there forever and it’ll be worth the up front cost.",228,77,negative,0.9074839949607848,305,"i was told i could offer more.i'm sure."" i was like, ""i'm not going to ask for 6%. we'll take 1%."" i said, ""no thanks."" i said, ""no thanks."" i said, ""i'm not going to ask for 6%. i'm going to take 1%."" i said, ""i'm not going to ask for 20%"

81,What's the best apartment deal you've ever found in New York City and where did you find it?,"in 2013 me and my ex at the time had a 4br 1bth apartment in crown heights for 2,400. it wasn’t that nice and the only reason we got it was because she found it with roommates and they all eventually left so we took over the lease. the amount of space was crazy though. streeteasy, $2,150 - park slope, 1br (plus an extra middle room/office), walk-in closet, been here 5 years w no rent increases well my mom found it not me but it’s a rent stabilized two bedroom apt for 1,200 a month. super sunny and a good size plus she updated the appliances. but she’s moving so i’ll be taking over and getting a roommate to split the rent with. i know several life long nyers paying sub $1k for their apartments on the ues. $2910/month for a [rent-stabilized] 1br apartment with balcony, washer, dryer, dishwasher, pet-friendly (no fee), parking garage ($250/mo), 24/7 concierge, free gym, with other amenities as well.   it’s absurd that $2910 is “a great deal” but yes.. we do think it’s great.  edited to add: found it on streeteasy rent stabilized 1100 square foot 2 bedroom with both a living room and a dining room (that they called a 3 bedroom) for under 1500 dollars at the time. somewhat neglected but french doors, crown moldings, clawfoot tub.   was casually chatting with a broker about no fee cheap places and she knew someone who worked with the landlord. moved in expecting to stay for a couple years just to save some money. still here many years later, when we're not traveling. $1.4k for a 600+ sq feet rent stabilized bedroom apt in sunnyside.   splitting it with my wife the past few years (just got married this weekend).   it's old, but it helps us save until we buy our own place. got a 3 br pretty large sunny apt rent stabilized for 2k right next to prospect park had to pay a broker fee but been here two years no rent increase my current apartment is a one bedroom in park slope. good size bedroom, huge living room, kitchen island. i pay $2050 and don't pay for utilities except internet. been here for 3 years now with no rent increase. i know how lucky i am and live in fear of losing it! 1000 dollar for a one bedroom up in inwood moved into a studio in a bed-stuy brownstone in 2020 for $1300. found on marketplace. that apartment was beautiful and i miss it often.  moved into a 2br around the corner from that studio in 2021 for $1700. found that one on some random local brokerage site—wasn’t listed elsewhere. i miss paying that much in rent, but don’t miss how much that apartment fell apart. ll was great, but wasn’t good longterm.  not necessarily the ‘best deal,’ but now live in a studio that’s a rs lottery across the street from domino park paying $2200. it’s a luxury building that has been great so far. i currently live in a rent stabilized 2 bedroom since 2015. fantastic landlord, very responsive and fixes things immediately (just had a new stove put in last year and a new fridge 3 years ago), 2 min walk from the d train in bk, laundry nearby, small building, quiet neighborhood, nice neighbors, relatively safe, close to industry city; i pay $1,500 a month.  i'm not moving until i absolutely have to thought this was nyccirclejerk for a min. anyway, i think i win this thread. i pay under $900 for a 2 br 2 bath luxury building in dtbk. thanks to 421a and rent stabilization. a friend called to ask me if i was interested in 8-room on cpw for $2900. i wasn’t working at that time (pandemic) so i couldn’t  afford it - oh did i mention balcony facing park? had a roommate for an apartment in soho that came from family. it was 3 bedroom 2 bath and huge living space. his family owned the apartment and let him rent it however he wanted. he kept the smallest room and wouldn’t rent out the master so i was in the other bedroom paying just $1,200 a month. in 2009 and i was just a baby idiot living on other peoples couches, i got a rent-controlled apartment with an absent roommate. i paid $400 rent. it *might* count as a scam to some people, because the bathtub was in the kitchen. i swear the more clueless you are the better your luck we should all help each other and keep advertising here when our leases are up 2018 i believe, midtown east close to ues, rent stabilized studio but with a separate bedroom area from the living room, $1888. was 10 minutes from work, high ceilings, no pests. second floor walk up.  only inconvenience was that i had to use the laundromat a block away and i absolutely hated that.  moved out mid pandemic.  oh, i found it on padmapper i believe. had to pay broker fees. long time ago a 1 bedroom in the west village for $1100. found it in the ny times. this was over 20 years ago but ues 2 bedroom 1 bath railroad 5 floor walk up, on 5th floor..$615 i had a covid priced full sized 1 bedroom on w. 77th just around the corner from the natural history museum for $1800/month in 2020. then 2 years later they wanted to raise it to $3400. 1750 for a 1.5 bedroom in bushwick, by the ridgewood border. $1800 1.5br 20 feet from the l in williamsburg 5 years ago. place sucked but it was nicely sized and cheap. i didn't find it. but my pops has been renting a rent stabilized 1br on the ues since the 70s, and be pays $750 a month. same size apartment across the hall is now $2300 i’m currently in the process of moving out of my beautiful true 1br nolita covid deal. it was an off-market listing i found through a broker who initially showed me another apartment on the block. i signed when there were no brokers fees for $2200/mo. it’s next to the church on mott, and had an updated kitchen, closets with built-ins, etc., etc. plus it’s rent stabilized! i lived here for three years, and i’m going to miss it, but hoping the next tenant enjoys it as much as i did. i was working with a broker and i asked “what else do you have?” and she showed me my current apartment that wasn’t listed yet. newly renovated, 2bd/1 bath for $2000 + utilities. apartments nearby are $4k+ (lic) very nice and sunny 1 bedroom + office in a small 3 apartment building in park slope for $2350 (heat and hot water included) last year in august. has a dishwasher, private backyard for the tenants and a laundry room. also comes with the sweetest landlady whom i adore. found it on craigslist and we were very lucky to get it because the competition was fierce (got it because the landlady loved our cats lol). we found a 3-bedroom, 1 bath in clinton hill for $3700.  on the tour the realtor gets to the kitchen and says oh yeah by the way, there's a surprise bonus 4th bedroom. a whole extra room attached to the kitchen with (2) windows, not on the listing. the place went from a reasonable deal to a massive find in the blink of an eye. old building which has its issues but space isn't one of them. [deleted] $2000 stabilized 1 bdrm on the upper west side! girlfriends aunt has a 1bed in midtown west for currently $900, she’s had it since ‘84 😂 man, way too late to go into details of it now, but i had the rep as the dream apt finding guy.       had a number of apts for 325 to 450 when everyone else was thinking 1500 was a steal. found sublets for 1200 when 2500 was the going rate and landed a 700mo legal sublet (found in village voice!!) on the best block in chelsea looking out at beautiful trees when 3k was the going rate. bought it from the sponsor for below market and did well on the sale after living in it 15yrs. for me i found a small house in astoria, 3bd, 2ba, completely renovated inside, front porch, tiny back yard, driveway and laundry in house. $3,200/m. and to make it even better my landlord is a regular guy with kids that lives in long island. in addition his house used to belong to his grandmother so he isn’t trying to nickel and dime us like these greedy corporate landlords.   what’s the catch. well the house is old and the ceiling are low. we have a rule in the house, people over 6’2” physically cannot enter the home. they are too tall lmao.   what makes it crazy is i got this house because the previous viewers couldn’t find a time to meet up and sign the lease. so we came in at 10pm the next day and stole the spot lmao. got a covid discount in feb. 2021 for a newer 2 bed in bed-stuy, and then the building became rent stabilized through a new law. my wife and i pay $2,500 plus $250 for a parking spot. i found a $850 dollar 1 bedroom with a huge living room a week ago and missed out on it   it was on 188th street in manhattan 2019 2b 1b with balcony in bedstuy, rent stabilized 2150. i had to leave that apartment to go abroad (and still there). i'm making plans to come back to ny in a couple of years and now regret not subletting my room when i left. $1800 a month for a rent stabilized 1 bed in astoria. only 2ish blocks away from the subway too. sadly no washer and dryer in-unit or in-building but the laundromat is only down the block. set your alerts for 2500 2-3 bedrooms on street easy and you'll see nice deals every week. they don't stay up long. covid deal - friend moved to les into a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom walkup for $3600 with wd.   as covid ended, the landlord wanted nearly double the amount so they bounced but what a deal. i rented a one bed for $1025 last year sunny apartment updated it was one of those cash for keys deal. 2012 on craigslist with no photos. 2 bedroom, entire top floor with amazing natural light in east harlem. recently renovated kitchen. rent stabilized. $1850/month.  my sister moved in with me year 2, i moved out year 4, she ended up staying there for 9 years until our golden doodle could no longer do the four floor walk up and she decided to move. it was amazing! 4 bedroom in ridgewood $1900 in 2019. i didn’t like the neighborhood or i would have taken over the lease after my roommates left. $1800 1bdr rent-stabilized in washington heights. super, elevator, laundry in the building. i got my apartment uws near 72nd, lofted studio with a balcony for $1950. i feel like i got it for a steal. 2021 covid deal 2 bedroom rs in bedstuy $2300. dishwasher and washer and dryer in building. i been here 3 years rent has gone up to $2398. it sucks i’m moving because i had a baby/got engaged since moving in and need more space. this was a great bachelorette pad 😫 $1,975 studio in washington square i found a (rent stabilized) 2 bedroom/ 1 bathroom in bedstuy back in 2021 for $2,000. came with in unit washer, gym, free laundromat, and was really close to transportation. the only reason why i left? had bedbugs. still one of my heaviest regrets to this day. 980 a month for 3rd floor walk up on e57, gave it up for a house in the burbs a long time ago. $1675, 1 bedroom apartments, washer/dryer combo in unit, ultra modern appliances with rain shower, virtual doorman. very safe place, i unintentionally left my bike and delivered packages first week of moving in. nobody even moved them from their original place. manhattan 109th $3200/mo  3 beds 1 bath  central air, in-unit laundry, full kitchen w/ stainless steel appliances, ceiling fans in every room, multiple skylights. fuckin ruled until the bar they didn't tell us was opening underneath us, well, opened my current apartment. found it in ~2012. 3 bedroom 1 bath on ocean parkway. got it for 1,800, but it was on a preferential rent rider and the first 3-4 years the increase was large to try and get up to “legal rent”. but after that, it’s only increased by rent stabilized rates. we’re now at 2,700. building is over 100 years old, so it’s not glamorous, but rent is split three ways between me, my partner and my brother. too comfy to leave. i currently live in a $1700 one bedroom in chinatown, which is a pretty good deal, but before that i lived in a $1400 one bedroom with triple exposure, high ceilings, ceiling fans, and radiant floor heating in sunset park. it was a great apartment but i moved so i could live in manhattan.  at one point my brother and i were living with 2 other people in a $1200 four bedroom, but the guy who had the lease was overcharging us so it wasn’t that great of a deal lol. my current place $1600/mo (went up like $100 in four years); pet friendly, rent controlled, gas/heat/hot water come with, lots of light, elevator, near a train and prospect park. the only catch is the building does have roaches though i only really see them in the kitchen. 😅   also i got this place at the end of 2019. used to have a big 2br on west 4th street in the village for $2350. this was in 2010. it wasn’t “nice” but the bedrooms and living room were huge. i got kicked out when the building got sold. they renovated my unit into a 3br that currently rents for $7000. my current place is 1700 with utilities in astoria. it’s a dated step down first floor but i’ve been able to give it love and a lot of cleaning to be nice - true one bedroom with private entrance. lived in an illegal 4br 2 bath for 2k a month. shared a br with a gf and i ended up paying less money here than where i moved from my college flop house (waaaaay east side of austin texas)  while the place wasn’t great it certainly wasn’t awful. there was the deal of a lifetime, central park south for under $1mm rent stabilized 2br in williamsburg, $2400 small one bedroom apartment in brooklyn heights $317 a month . . . . . in 1981 $1500 for a very large 2 bedroom (we fit an 8 seat dining table in it). pretty outdated, very strict no pet policy, and the landlord only rented it to my ex and i because she wanted a “nice couple who will use the second bedroom for a baby” (lol literally never but i’m not saying anything). turned out to be not such a great deal because the landlord was an elderly italian woman who use to ask us to come in and help reapply icy hot patches on her back… boobs out and all. bensonhurst/gravesend area. neighborhood was dead but we were walking distance to 3 grocery stores, and the train was a 45 second walk.  it was unlisted. a broker knew the landlord’s son. i’ve only ever lived in small family own homes, and i prefer it. my current place that i've been in since early 2016! it's $1680 for a very large (nearly 1000 sq ft) 2-br in bushwick that was built in 2008 and the rent has gone up a total of $130 since i first moved in. i found it on craigslist when my original roommate was looking for someone and i became the sole leaseholder when she left in 2017. if my landlords ever try to sell the building like they almost did during covid, i'll probably try to figure out a way to buy my unit or the building from them. a friend of mine found a rent stabilized studio in lic for about $1800 a month. she’s still paying that price today.   eta: i haven’t browsed apartments in nyc in about 3 years, and i am *shocked* by some of the comments here. in 2021 and beforehand, it was easy for me to find a 1 bed for $2000 or less, especially in brooklyn. shoo i almost moved into a $2000 a month studio in brooklyn heights. rent has gotten that expensive?!??! 2 bed in the west village for 2k during covid…best apt of my life my current place. 2 bedroom 1 br on ues for 3250 i found my 1.5 bedroom apartment in astoria for $1,300 in 2021—the rent is now $1,500 and i split it with my fiancée! it’s small but it’s allowing us to save for our wedding, so worth it. i could never afford 3k a month found a 1300 stabilized studio in prospect lefferts in 2021.  still here. just moved here in november: $2350 rent stabilized 2 bedroom (big rooms), washer/ dryer, dishwasher, deep bathtub in prospect park south/ flatbush. i found out later that some other units in the building aren’t well-maintained and that my one neighbor is a bit of an ass, but the space itself is amazing last year i was living in a 2 bedroom with my gf and a roommate, rent was about 1,400 i found a duplex loft apt (1.5 bathrooms) with a spiral staircase, sunroof and private terrace in kips bay / gramercy for $3,800. i saw it on streeteasy at 9am and took it off market within 2 hours - had to run from my office because i knew it wouldn't be on the market for long. similar style apts now going for over $5,000... $1670 a month for a 1.5 bedroom in park slope. rent stabilized. we took over the lease from a friend who was moving out of new york. building has its issues but we’re not leaving until we buy a place. what a 1.5 bedroom? rent stabilized 3 bedroom for $2900, all utilities included. laundry in building, no dishwasher though. i really wanted a dishwasher in our next place but stabilization and free electric was well worth it—we’ve never used the ac so freely lol. no where near as good as some of the deals here. but i am proud of my current find. 1 bedroom apartment that fits a king bed, heart of les, less than a block from the subway, laundry in unit, dish washer, also dead quiet at night despite being on two bars, 2695 a month. i hope the rent increases aren't too bad, because i will stay here for 3 years at least if they aren't. 2009. after the financial crash they were giving crazy incentives and cheap rent. lived in a brownstone with a back yard and 2 floors and two working fireplaces beautifully redone inside. was 88th and cpw. 8k a month. was a steal then. now forget about it. was sad when we moved to the westchester burbs four years later. greenpoint during covid, a 2 bd 2br 1000 sq ft luxury apartment, amazing views, location was between chelsea/hudson yards for 3 months free so net was around $3500. the bedrooms were huge. the next year, we somehow finessed another month free so it was still a great deal. then, the third year it went up pretty dramatically to $7900 lmfao hearing about what people pay who grew up on the west side will always kill me. $225 a month, 2nd ave in the 30's.  got the lead from a contractor who was painting our offices.  he took me to see it during my lunch and the next day i went to see the landlord about it with cash in hand.  ok, it was the late 1970's but still .... moved in to a 1 bedroom 2010 washington heights (162nd st/amst) rent stabilized $1350. paying $1575 2yr lease currently 2018 me and a friend had a 2br in a prime location in bushwick for $1,900 total. rent never went up. not the best apt deal but i had a $3600 tiny 2 bed in upper east side. dishwasher & laundry in building with package room. gated entryway and courtyard.   utilities & furnished for $3600. not the worst thing in manhattan! 2450$ flex three in on seventh ave park slope that i shared with two friends. i think we found it through a broker after seeing a different listing with them. it was an old af row house railroad with two tiny true bedrooms and one person got the middle room which was way bigger but had no windows. however it was two blocks from prospect park, we were like 24, and the landlord didn’t raise our rent. 1800 rent stabilized all utilities included 1 bedroom recently gutted & upgraded 1,000 sq ft 6 floors elevator laundry 2 blocks from grocery and train i got in 2020 ❤️ (right now rent is 1916 splitting it with my partner so i pay less than 1k) 1200$ section 8 in fordham manor, 1 bed 1 bath on first floor of walk up building right before covid. was sketchy as hell but just a block from the subway. same place after i returned a year later after furlough was 2200$. i found it in 2002. 3 bed 2 bath with an open concept kitchen, updated appliances, and a dishwasher for 2300. found it on streeteasy. my parents’ apartment was a 2bd2bath rent stabilized for $1650/mo with parking space in the garage. this was in elmhurst queens. i took it over with my fiancé for a year when they left. i’ve got a 2 bedroom on prospect park for 3.1k, newly renovated with central air and in-unit laundry. found it on streeteasy last year, renting from a private landlord who is increasing the rent just 3% next year. rent stabilized 2 bed/2 bath entire top floor with huge private, furnished roof for $2250 in sunset park.  no rent increase in 3 years. found on apartments.com 1 bedroom in astoria, rent stabilized for 1850$ with a balcony, (a tile balcony not those steel frame ones) been here since 2018.   hra helps me out with 430$ for rent, so i pay only 1420$ 2 large bed 1 bath, w/d, new kitchen, 6 closets, 8 windows, 800 sq ft for $2,500 rent stabilized in fort greene, got it during covid and not leaving anytime soon. twice my previous mortgage in the midwest but somehow still feels like a win lol!! 10 years ago we moved into a 5bdr 2bath duplex in bushwick — at $2650. different-sized rooms, no neighbors besides the landlord's nice grandmother downstairs. the trade-off was he was a shit landlord but the numbers were absurd! crown heights in 2013 i had a 3 bedroom for $2,000 that was insanely huge. the building was gross and the floors were all crooked but i had roommates, the largest room in the apartment and paid $725 per month.  moved out because the neighborhood was getting super pricy (im from queens originally)  so i moved back to queens to astoria and into the upstairs of a 2 family house $1700 per month, 1 bedroom,  with electric, heat and hot water included in the rent. my landlady there never raised the rent in the 7 years i lived there. i got my apartment in flatiron for $2500 3 years ago, nice full sized 1 bedroom with an additional loft space where i have another queen bed on park ave on a street where a studio typically runs $4000+. ofc now i am paying around $3100 but i regularly update the apartment and am still stealing my space for what the neighborhood runs. top floor, elevator building, extremely close to everything ill ever need. i think about moving, but i just cant let this place go because the location is so incredible. some people would talk down on it, but in my eyes, ive got a deal. l-shaped  studio, ues, elevator, laundry in basement. nothing fancy, but my rent is still in 3 digits.  been here 13 years, they'll have to pull my dead body out lol.  i was frantic i had 2.5 days to find somewhere to live.  a coworker's father was the head of maintenance for the landlord.  i think it's just dumb luck, people!   (years ago, i also had a great deal in sf that i found just from a handwritten sign in a window.) in 2017 i had found a walk up studio apartment in one of the nicest tree lined streets in chelsea for $1850. not a fancy apartment, but i didnt mind at all for that location i currently have a 2 br in crown heights next to the brooklyn museum and the express 456 lines.  it just went up to 2050 a month $1800 for 2 bedrooms in astoria in 2021. i got it from lease takeover thru my friend! i wished i could stayed longer, but my life has changed back then. my girlfriend and i wanted to avoid a broker’s fee so we went door to door in hell’s kitchen, asking doormen at different apartment buildings if any apartments in the building were for rent by owners. one doorman in a new building on 54th st. between 9th and 10th said yes and handed us the business card of the owner of a vacant apartment. the owner had moved overseas for work and was looking to rent her large 1br/1ba apartment, about 850 square feet, in excellent condition. we signed a one-year lease and got the apartment for $1,100 a month. we stayed for three and a half years, with our monthly rent going up to $1,200 in our last year there.   mind you, this was in 1995. had a studio on 70th and 1st avenue around 2010-2012 for $800 a month. yes i realize that was a lifetime ago but still! $1500 huge railroad style studio rent stabilized in williamsburg college was ending in the bronx so had to be out within a month. went to move some stuff to my parents house in queens and saw a sign for 2 bedroom for rent in a condo building 2 doors down. signed the paperwork the next day. 2 bed/2 bath with a huge backyard for 2200. backyard came in handy during covid. 3 bed 3 bath right on buffalo ave and eastern parkway for $3,600. each room had its own bathroom access. we had a private driveway, with a beautiful kitchen and living room space. and the super lived downstairs. i miss that place soooo much 😭😭 $3100k for 4 bed 2 bath. rent stabilized, laundry in building, elevator. we’re in washington heights and there’s four of us living here. my roommates found it during the pandemic. from 2013 to 2017 i had a huge 2 bedroom apartment on an iconic tree lined street in the west village and paid $1,500 all in. no roommates. it was a handshake deal i found in a facebook group. the owner was nice, but mysterious and likely into sketchy business. in 5 years i only ever knew him by his first name. he lived out of the country and i paid him rent on venmo. the only stipulation was that when he came back into town about once per year, he was able to stay in the extra bedroom with its own separate entrance if he coordinated with me ahead of time. he also left behind a cat that i was responsible for taking care of in exchange for him continuing to pay all utilities. i’m dead serious. the whole thing was so weird but it worked and it was so nice to live there for that rent i didn’t ask too many questions. i’m currently in a recently renovated rent stabilized one bedroom in an elevator building in hamilton heights and pay $2150/mo. i think it’s a great deal and will be here for a while. it’s a true one bedroom with ample closet space and updated appliances, with dishwasher. streeteasy, $4k - w village 1bed, 900 sqft corner unit with views to the hudson river and empire state building… and a working wood fireplace. had to move out after my ex and i split up and i couldn’t afford it solo. next tenant paid $6.8k i lived in nyc for 20 years off and on, more than half of that time i had little to no rent. i would rent a larger mix use space, subdivide it, and rent out the other spaces to cover my rent. i did this in three different locations 1 in mid town and two in williamsburg.  all found by talking to people in those neighborhoods.  in nyc you gotta either be resourceful or already have resources if you want a decent quality of life! during the peak of covid: nice place,  2bd, 2 bath, balcony, elevator, washer, dryer, dishwasher, ues, under $4k. rent has increased since then but barely. $2000 2br with a decent sized backyard. originally signed at $1900 in 2018 so only one $100 rent increase which i negotiated down (they wanted to raise it $200). i guess that means it’s rent stabilized? totally lucked into it, found on a craigslist ad posted by nooklyn. throughout most of 2010-2018 i had a beautiful one bedroom in chelsea. pre-war building on 15th st. $2250/mo and they barely raised the rent ever. i think is was $2500 when i left. $875 for the smaller bedroom in a 2br/1ba garden level apartment in astoria ($1800 total rent) on craigslist, 2016. the 90-year-old greek owner/landlord lived upstairs and we knocked on his door every month to give him rent checks. he shared tomatoes from his terrace garden every summer. 🥰 but every time i asked for a repair, he took it personally: “50 years, no problem!” i eventually got tired of roommates and moved out. we signed a multi year lease on the uws in january 2021 for a big one bedroom apartment with a crazy view of central park, doorman, elevator etc (and ok with our large dog!!) for $2700 a month. we’re looking for a bigger place now and it breaks my heart to leave. i have a 3 bedroom in greenpoint brooklyn for $2500 a month. renovated when i moved in around 2021. downstairs neighbor has a huge backyard that i am welcome to use since they travel a lot. i rent out one of the rooms occasionally but being able to live alone in nyc was a dream of mine. i’ve been in my crown heights rent-stabilized 3-bedroom 1.5 bath for 17 years now. rent was $1900. now it’s $2600. have lived here with roommates until last month when they moved out and my boyfriend moved in. we’re updating everything and making it swanky. i will not be leaving. at first it really sucked - i was paying about 2000$ a month to live in a bedroom in a 4 bed/2bathroom that was absurdly tiny. i’m talking my room was like 9x12 feet with a radiator. however my 3 other roommates lease ended early & mine was still active for 6 months so i had the entire apartment to myself. 2.1k for a 2  bedroom/1.5 bathroom  top floor of a house with the kitchen on the floor below.. balconies on each floor. ditmas park 2020 in june $1,800 500 sqft studio in the ues on the second floor in renovated building with plenty of sunlight. not the best but still here three years later. my friend lives in a 2-bedroom rent controlled apartment in the west village for $1080 (i used to live with him but eventually couldn't handle the hoarding) and his family has a huge rent-controlled apartment which is less than $500/month nearby (2 bedrooms + a living room + entry hall), they've been on the lease since 1951. 3k for a 1.5 bedroom is a good deal? lol since when? $1950, 1000 sq ft, 1 bed, 2020, manhattan. parked myself on streeteasy for months. in 2021 i got a covid special deal in midtown with a friend for $1500. in 2022 we renewed for $1550 and didn’t get a lease at all in 2023. a recent search on zillow shows that they took a month to get a new tenant at nearly triple the rent. 2300/mo in 2013. 1bd, brand new (i was the first occupant in a new build), manhattan views, gym, doorman.  court square lic before it was cool. west harlem - 2 bedroom with newish kitchen, pet friendly, across from a park and rent stabilized - $2100  found through a broker. had come available that morning and we snatched it that afternoon. in 2015/2016 i had a massive two bedroom in astoria, a 3 min walk from the astoria blvd nq train, for $1800 a month. i had to leave because the landlords were crazy (they lived downstairs on the bottom two floors). i am not sure what that would go for now, but i assume $3000 plus.   more recently, in yorkville from 2019-2021 i had a massive two bedroom (granted, 5th floor walk up) with separate kitchen, huge closets, etc. on e 88th st for $2800. it was probably 900 sqft. i asked my neighbors on oneroof app 2br - 1500/mo in bed stuy.   i’m living the best deal. major tradeoffs exist. 2 bedroom 1 bathroom, great neighborhood $2200. gate keeping. a friend of mine found a pretty big studio in east village for $1400 a month on craigslist. plus it's rent stabilized! if anyone has any leads on an apartment (or even a room) in brooklyn, please message me. i'm happy to talk details. it would be deeply, deeply, appreciated. yes and how can i have your steal?

82,I Forgot How Much I Hate Real Estate Agents ,"scammed all the way good faith deposits aren't legal, but too many people still ask for them. it’s organized crime and i will die on that hill. in my 15 years there i went through every scam imaginable i think. my favorite story is the time i paid a broker his fee, first and last, and then he fled the country. even the company didn’t know where he went. i scammed my way into the office (because they had a door buzzer and wouldn’t return my calls) and they tried to say they couldn’t help me. i threatened to start breaking everything in the office until the damages matched the money i was out - and i was dead serious. like willing to go to jail.i  walked away with cash in hand. fuck all real estate agents in that sinking cesspool. when you can't teach, you teach gym. when you can't teach gym, you become a real estate broker. worst of the worst. sounds like you were scammed the good faith deposit is illegal, not to mention usually multiple brokers are working the same apartment, so whichever one of them gets through first, and they all could be collecting good faith deposits, or just have a better renter. the reason these scams work is because there is so much money available in new york city that they don’t care if they lose business from honest people like yourself i mean the 1st one is purely the landlords decision, i’m sure the real estate agent wasn’t excited to go through the cost of listing and time to show just for the owner to resign the existing tenants. ah the good ol “pay the fee to apply for the apartment to later find out it was already being processed by another entity” switcheroo… man, i hated when that happened to me too.   i lost $200 cuz of this. broker wannabe sent a person to show me 3 apartments in the same area. out of the 3 apartments, the only two they (apparently) had no control over were the ones that i applied to, and they didn’t even had the decency to let me know beforehand. when i first sent the application (first $100), a day later they told me that that apartment was already being processed by someone else. i sorta thought this was normal since i saw the same apartment in another websites listing.  i shrugged it off and decided to apply for the second one after tirelessly asking the broker about the availability of the second one. that’s how i lost the second $100. everything went to shit when the guy stopped returning my messages or emails. left a review to his page on google reviews after that. during my scathing review, that’s when i found out the guy is a pretty scummy guy, he leaves everyone hanging apparently. small brokerage company and this is a pretty normal move from them. never again. i’m a real estate agent in nyc, mostly queens / brooklyn. i hate doing rentals, but will do them every once in a while for a friend or loyal client.   deposits to hold apartments are illegal, especially just to view it. so are absurdly large application fees (idr what the cap is now). every agent has a broker, if you feel the agent is acting shady, contact the broker directly. message / email to have proof. broker usually doesn’t allow shit that’ll get the entire office in trouble with the state and board. >one of the bedrooms has no windows.     a bedroom without a window is not a thing. it’s always been awful.  we need more commercial managed properties to avoid this mess and more tenancy’s rights.   sometimes i wonder if we would all benefit from some type of match program instead of this level of crazy. stay strong, friend. it is tough out there, but don't give up! application fees refunded? yeah. im supposed to move and could find better for cheaper but just cannot deal with trying to fight my way through this process. it's convenient to hate on real estate agents, but the first situation sounds like the current tenant screwed you over. second situation sounds iffy but depending on the price, you probably are getting bottom of the barrel stuff. also, good faith deposits are very common. rentals move lightning fast and deposits are kinda the only way both sides of the deal know they're serious. third situation sounds like a scam though. it's a tough market. maybe thats the reason the tenant in that first apartment decided to stay. that's not the agents fault. the fact that the next two apartments sucked should reinforce the notion that when you see a good one you'll need to jump on it. blaming agents is like blaming workers at the supermarket because the price of steaks went up.",224,34,negative,0.8910483717918396,258,"it sounds like you were scammed. it's tough out there, friend. stay strong, friend. it's tough market. third situation sounds like a scam though. it's tough market. maybe thats the reason the tenant in that first apartment decided to stay. good faith deposits aren't legal, but too many people still ask for them. i went through every scam imaginable in my 15 years as a real estate agent. i"
83,"Accepted a Job in the City, Now I'm Scared I Can't Afford NYC","1/ yes it’s pretty standard to have a 40x requirement and there’s plenty of eligible renters. you’ll need a guarantor if you don’t earn enough. most folks have roommates in their twenties.  2/ 1 month security plus first months rent plus a month’s worth for broker fee is pretty common. you can try to avoid broker fees but it’s tricky. definitely learn how to avoid common junk/illegal fees like key money; the city has a lot of good resources for renters. https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page  3/ for the most part landlords only care that you’ve got stable employment and make enough to pay the rent. again annual gross 40x monthly is a standard requirement; if you meet this you shouldn’t need a guarantor.  4/ you get what you pay for. i strongly recommend living in a neighborhood you like in a lesser apartment and/or with roommates to make it more affordable, versus a better apartment where you don’t want to live. nobody lives here because they love their apartment. we live here because we love our neighborhoods and city.  pro tip- look up building history on the hpd website (https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/hpd-online.page) to see violations and complaint history. every building has problems; what you want to see is that they’re addressed, and not recurring or consistent. leaks happen. mice happen. heat issues happen. you don’t want roaches. you don’t want a place where they don’t resolve violations quickly. roommates? you don't have to live in manhattan. look for areas in queens or brooklyn that are close to the train lines. much cheaper compared to manhattan 1. it varies. you need to show you make 40x the monthly rent to get accepted for most apartments, but you could also pay less if you find a cheaper place.   2. brokers are parasites who unfortunately are allowed to take exorbitant fees from tenants for basically nothing (they work for the landlord). however, you can try to negotiate with them. i'd say 15% is standard, so really less than 3-4 months' rent. but i've gotten them down to 10% in a couple of instances.  3. you may want to get a letter from your new employer attesting to your current salary, in addition to the past tax returns.  nyc is definitely expensive and the rental market is a shit show now but it's an amazing and unique place to live if you can make it work. 1) 40x is a qualifier. if you desire to rent a $2000 apartment, you need to make 40x (i believe gross) - $80k. i have seen this pretty much universally - market rate apartments, manhattan, brooklyn, queens. this rule is not very different from the ""you must make 3x rent per month"" - it's effectively the same qualification that you would find in any other city in the us.  2) brokers/realtors/agents -- if you hire an agent for full service search on your behalf, you should expect to pay. the fee is typically 15% annual rent. if you do the search yourself, whoever is listing the apartment on behalf of a building or landlord will also try to charge you the same fee. this is different from what you might experience in other cities. trying pay less in broker/agent's fee is doable, for example: streeteasy has a ""no fee"" filter. good luck      3) in my experience, you can provide your current/latest paystubs and a proof of employment letter. your future employer states that you will be employed at specific salary. that serves as a good way to prove that you will have the income necessary to afford the rent.      4) wild... a lot of people live with roommates. so if you can live with roommates, you can save a decent chunk. so if you aren't making big money, you can still afford to live in nyc, some live further into the outer boroughs, some live with roommates. the desirable places are expensive, simple. (and with so many millions of people, the definition of desirable is very subjective) it’d be a lot more helpful if you say how much you’re making and a general area you’d like to live within nyc 1. 40x rent is just the rule to rent an apartment. you are welcome to find a cheaper apartment—i know people who make 100k but pay less than 2.5k—but most landlords will not rent to you unless you make a firm 40x. if you have more money, you're probably willing to spend more money for either a bigger apartment or a bigger area, but nobody's gonna give you grief for living *below* your means. figure out what you, personally, can realistically afford, do not exceed that.  2. yes, 99% of brokers are absolute ticks on the system and unless you limit your search to no-fee places, you can generally expect to pay 15% of the annual price as a fee...sometimes more, sometimes less. no-fee listings do exist but they're competitive for obvious reasons. yes, we all know it sucks, it has gotten worse in recent years.  3. they'll want to see your tax returns regardless but you can also include an offer letter from your new workplace stating your new income and that number should suffice as 40x proof.  4. roommates, live farther out in a borough, don't get starry-eyed about living in the most expensive/luxury building or area that you can afford, be smart about where you shop for groceries/clothes/etc. honestly i'd probably not save money living elsewhere because here i don't have any car expenses—i'd be able to have more *space* in another part of the country, but it wouldn't actually save me any *money*. i'm fine without the space. i have fun here. 1. you live wherever you can afford, and looks good to you (commute, layout, neighborhood). the 40x rule is just that most landlords and building management companies will only rent to you if you’re making 40x the rent, have good credit, etc. 2. $20 application fee, security deposit (1 month rent), first month rent, and usually a broker fee, as most units you will find have a broker who gets paid to show the unit, unless you filter for “no fee” units on streeteasy or find an independent landlord. 3. if you’re currently making 40x rent and have good credit then you’re fine, and won’t require guarantor. 4. yes apartment hunting in nyc is one of the worst things anyone can go through. expect to eventually settle on a place that doesn’t have everything on your wishlist, but you’ll find that most people do this and it will be okay. summer months are also notoriously the worst as that’s when most people are moving.   something i did once was put my things in a storage unit for a few months (found one out in queens for like $150 a month) and subletted while i looked for a new apartment. you could look into subletting, either a room or a whole place, so you don’t have to have a huge commitment. good luck! if you’re making 150k you’ll be fine living on your own as long as you aren’t trying to find a super luxurious apartment. you can afford a 3k per month apartment and be completely fine. i moved to nyc on a 50k salary! i had one roommate and my half of the rent was $1300 with utilities in a 2br in east harlem. i just got a significant raise but want to save more money so i just moved to washington heights with 2 roommates (friends of mine) and pay $1100 with utilities included.  i almost got a studio for $1400 in dykeman but i love living with people and i wouldn't be able to save money really.  so, that's all being said you could definitely move to nyc on a $150k salary. just work out your finances (what do you make after taxes, how much do you want to save, do you have loans, etc). i loved living in east harlem and was not that far from midtown compared to friends commuting to work from the bronx, brooklyn, etc. you have a lot of options!   i did not have a broker's fee for either apartment just the security deposit that was equal to one month's rent. i did not have a co-signer or a guarantor and have an extremely high credit score with no loans. why don't you just tell us how much you make? what's with the secrecy? 1) you should pay what you can afford. 40x the rent used to be a recommendation for the threshold your rent should be. now it’s a standard that landlords require for the most part. $2500 is actually a good deal in nyc, especially in the hot spots.   2) because of the demand for apartments here, most apartments are shown through a broker. brokers deal with all the applicants and show the place because there’s a lot of ppl trying to get an apartment. up front fees consist of 1st months rent, deposit which is equal to 1 months rent, broker fee sometimes equal to 1 months rent. the city is working on passing a law stating who ever hired the broker to pay the broker fee. it’s possible to find apartments without broker fees but the competition will be even higher. most good apartments usually aren’t on the market for longer than a week, maybe less.   3) let them know you just got a new job, show them an offer letter along with whatever else they’re requesting. you should be fine.  4) most ppl live with ppl to cut costs, whether that’s roommates, family, or a significant other. if you don’t make a lot of money like a lot of us regular ppl, you can afford to live here if you’re living with someone, also living farther from manhattan helps. i moved to new york and lived on minimum wage jobs for years. roommates yes, but still 100k you’re not even gonna suffer! haha- i’m meaning to say, you’ll do great and get a cool apartment for 2k-3k and enjoy it. brooklyn and queens by the subway you’ll be taking the most. have fun! i just did the apartment search and got a place also as a late 20s guy who’s moving from out of state (though i am from the nyc area originally) so here’s my experience:  1. you need to make 40x the monthly rent to qualify but that doesn’t mean you have to pay that much. you can pay less than that if you find a cheaper place have roommates or otherwise get lucky. most of the units i saw the 40x was base salary only not including annual bonus but some did include that, so don’t be afraid to ask and clarify on that.   2. my broker fee was 12% of the annual rent. so just under $4k for me (the rent for my place is $2,695). where i come from broker fees aren’t a thing so that was definitely a sticker shock. there are apartments that don’t have a broker fee but there’s less of them. i found my place on streeteasy; basically you reach out and you set up a time with the broker to see the place and usually you give them your application materials.   3. i showed them my offer letter that showed i was making more money than at my current job. so that, plus my prior 2 years of tax returns w2s etc. was fine. also, my apartment the landlords reached out to my employer and my prior building to verify that i actually started at my new job and that i was a tenant in good standing in my former building out of state. not every landlord may do this but mine did so just be prepared. 1. people who make 100k often have roomates and i'd recommend it if i was under 30. people live like college students for longer. generally living alone or with one roomate is a big premium in new york. it's fairly easy to find a room for 1000 to 1500. if your willing to pay a bit more, 3 roommates with a 2k budget (6k total) will get a lot nicer place than someone can get for 3k on their own.  2. 40x is upper limit for that you qualify for. people who make 400k don't necessarily rent 10k apartments, most of them are renting 3 to 5k places.  3. brokers are real estate agent. nyc most buildings do not have leasing offices. they essentially handle filtering applications for land lords. currently in nyc brokers are either paid by tenants or land lords, and when land lord pays its a no fee apartment. typically nicer apartments at lower price points have fees, luxury units are less likely to have fees. think about land lords incentives. if they know they have a place that they can rent tomorrow, why would they pay the brokers fee and not have the tenant do it instead?  4. typical broker fee is one to two months, generally there is a deposit of one month and you hage first months rent. generally expect to need 2 to 4 months worth  of rent on hand to move in on your own somewhere.   5. may through august seems to be hell for renting.  6. most land lords and especially bigger ones will accept an offer letter if your don't have 3 months worth of stubs. i've only been here a year, but i'm just now moving to jersey city -- the rent is mildly cheaper (but it feels like a breath of fresh air after dealing with nyc apartments!), and the path train happens to lead directly to my work. also, when i visited, it was a lot quieter and streets felt less dirty/crowded in jersey.  i'm going for like luxury apartment type of thing, but i'd imagine it'd also be good for someone looking to cut costs bc manhattan can be super expensive i make over 100k. my rent isn't over 1900. i would pay less because if you already hit your max you are not going to be able to afford rent next year unless you are rent stabilized.   you can show current pay with your paystubs. you’re in your twenties. come and figure it out. good answers here on the need for proof of income, a guarantor, etc. i moved to nyc last year. the only additional thing i'd suggest is to find a short term (3-6 mo) furnished room sublet if you can, and then apartment  hunt from there. it'll give you a chance to get to know the neighborhoods in the city, how much commute time you can tolerate (further from manhattan is cheaper), and it'll give you a chance to look around and know what you're looking at. this is a terrible time to apartment hunt for an affordable apartment because all the students are looking as well for next fall, but rents will go down slightly after school starts. i don't know what your target rent is, but the more roommates you have, the cheaper it will be. i'm a performer with side jobs, and in my mid-20's so my budget is tiny. i make just under $50k a year at this point. i live in queens and pay about $1100 for my room in a four bedroom, plus 1/4 of the gas and electric bill. because i came out here without a job in place, i used a parent guarantor, who had to show 100x the rent. the good news is that i only had to pay one month's rent as a down payment, no final month's rent, and no brokers fee because i went through an advertisement by the leasing agency vs. a broker. you can find those deals if you have time to look vs being under pressure to find something immediately. as far as roommates go, lots of people in nyc move in with strangers. it's often a necessity here. my lease is also unusual in that it's just for my room vs. the entire apartment, so i'm not responsible if roommates don't pay. bring your offer letter bank statement and last few w2s. you need collectively 40x.   even studios are like 3-4k right now. manhattan may not be affordable for you. look further out. suck it up your first year. no one here could totally afford it but boy is it fun! hi i am going to take on question 2.  so people casually use the terms brokers, realtors and agents in conversation but i will break it down for you exactly.  in other parts of the country the term realtor is pretty common. to be a realtor you have to be a member of the realtor association which almost nobody in most of nyc is. it is a bit more common outer parts of queens and staten island, and maybe a bit of brooklyn.  in nys there are three types of licenses.  broker  associate broker  licensed real estate salesperson. (commonly called agent)  if you are an ab or an lres you have to have a broker hold your license, and money and listings have to flow through them. you are basically working jointly with your broker and almost always they are getting a share of your commission or you are paying them a fee for service.  any of these titles can represent a landlord, any of them can represent a tenant.  if you want your own agent you can have that person set up showings, represent you, and negotiate for you. if it's an apartment with a traditional fee, they would split the money with the listing agent. in other scenarios a landlord might pay them or you might pay only them.  that all works the same way whether they are a broker, associate broker or lres (agent.)  a broker does need to be more experienced, and take a longer exam, but really plenty of lres agents know what they are doing and unless they want to move towards owning a business there is not really a need to get the higher title.  hope that helps!  suzanne there are a lot of  1 or 2 bedroom basement apartments in jamaica ny for under 1.5k. 1/ yeah and you should pay even less than that. tbh i’ve had rent applications deny me even though i made a bit more than 40x the rent because “it was too close” and someone else had a higher salary. overall not a bad idea to live under your means especially with rent. highly recommend roommates.   2/ yes this is an unfortunate truth in nyc. some brokers charge a lot for minimal work too. you can try negotiating but apartments are in high demand in nyc so it may or may not work. hopefully legislation may change this absurdity soon.   3/ depends on the landlord. if it’s a company then they want to see more. overall they want to see you can afford to pay rent in the apartment and have enough in a savings account. i personally don’t like when they ask you for too much unless it’s a lottery apt (who really needs to see tax returns?).   4/ you can afford it depending on what you want. i was making 60k living with a roommate in bushwick years ago. salary got bumped up to almost 100k so i live alone in southern brooklyn because rent is much cheaper although farther from the center of nyc.   if you want to live in the middle of everything, you’ll most likely need roommates or be really good at searching (or just lucky!) good rule of thumb in nyc when it comes to renting is of the three options, choose 1 you’re willing to take the l on: rent price, location, amenities.  edit: one other quirk of nyc renting is seasonality. if you’re moving now, it sucks. but in the months of february to april, renting gets a bit cheaper although inventory also goes down. you can definitely find more affordable options if you eventually decide to move and have the option to search on the spring. you can definitely find a place with your income of 100 to 150k, but if you give where you are going to work, like midtown, lower east, etc, people can give you better advice. also, longer you wait, fewer choices you will have going into summer, the worst season. 1. yes 2. more than 12% annual rent is too much.  look for no fee.   3. offer letter will work.  make sure you have a good amount in savings.  borrow if you need to.  4. yes.  plenty of people sub 100k have their own apartments.    tip: look in cheaper neighborhoods ues is still i think best deal in city.  maybe sunset park.  williamsburg is shit for so many reasons 1. yes and no. i live with my partner, i make in the mid 100s and pay about 2k a month as my portion of rent. 40x range is primarily the upper boundary for what a landlord will approve - it’s less about how much rent you pay and more about how much you need to earn to rent an apartment at x rent.   2. streeteasy has a filter for “no fee” apartments, wherein the ll foots the bill for the broker. it usually costs 1 month or 15% of 1 year. with that said you’ll be paying first month and 1 month deposit up front, so yes, in a way you’ll be paying 3-4 months of rent up front. but first month is something you’d pay anyway, deposit you (presumably) get back. broker’s fee does in fact just feel like shit but what can you do?   3. they usually ask for an offer letter for your current job too. your current/new salary will be stated there. they’ll likely also ask you how much you make, and you can communicate with the broker to make it clear you’re starting a higher paying job.   4. i originally moved here for a job that paid 85k. i had a roommate in a two bed that cost ~2750 and we split it down the middle. it was totally fine and i never had to worry much about money. if i was making >70 i’d have probably felt less comfortable but over that and you’ll do okay. median nyc income is still about 40k sooo idrk how they do it but if they can do it you can too. long island city find yourself a roommate/ house share situation for short term then take your time nyc is big. even if you're working in manhattan, you can live in brooklyn or queens and commute. that'll be the best way to save money and still not live in a closet size apartment. other boroughs are significantly more affordable than uptown highly recommend subletting first before moving to nyc. you will not know where you want to live or what anything is like until you’re physically here. find a furnished room in a neighborhood that interests you for 2-3 months when you move. find your actual next apartment once you’ve lived here a few months, it will be way easier and you won’t make weird mistakes. you can find sublets in a variety of facebook groups (search “sublet nyc” in groups a bunch will come up). folks also post sublets in neighborhood groups on fb (search the neighborhood you want to live in in fb groups and you’ll find them). the listings project is also a good resource. use streeteasy.  click on no brokers and no fees in the search function.  also price range.  expect to pay 2500 a month for a studio apartment.  both of my boys live there. 1. yes but that is still a huge part of your income so from a financial planning pov i wouldn't pay that much. i pay less than 10% of my income on rent on my unit with no roommates but i lucked out hard with my spot.  2. broker fee is up to 15% of annual rent. there are plenty of no fee options but they're not as desirable of a unit. i found you can get that down if you're willing to pay in cash (i went from 12% to 10% by paying in cash) 3. as long as you have a letter that shows what you make now it should be fine. however think of each application like a job application, you have to stand out as a candidate. i wrote a financial summary, gave them more financial documents than they asked for, and included a cover letter to explain my employment history, especially why i make a lot more some years than others.  4. i pay $2900 for a 2 bed/2 bath, 1300 sq ft rent-controlled apartment with a massive private garden, in-unit and full chef kitchen. 2 mins from the subway. i was able to get this last month, so yeah, amazing deals do still exist but you have to be really on it, almost annoying with the brokers and make sure you're ready to go with a put-together application. have you thought about moving to certain areas of queens and or brooklyn to save money? potentially even areas of nj such as hoboken? welcome.to nyc where no one without a trust fund can afford to live here...  1. to qualify and have a chance of getting approved for an apt, yes household income shouod be 40x the rent.  2. ok realtor is a national kinda like a union, more like a.trade guild, more realtors in ny are outside of the city. in nyc most agents from major and mid size brokerages are rebny. either way their are rules and code of ethics members must follow.or.face super steep fines. now in ny the difference between broker, associate broker, and salesperson is based and what their license says. everyone who is a rel.estate agent  starts as a salesperson..in order to get your broker 's license, that requires more education hours and a number of.points towards that license based on successful deals and kind of deals in order to be eligible, and then passing additional test from the state. a broker is able to start their own brokerage and have salespeople working underneath them or work by themselves. an associate broker basically has gone through all those motions but doesn't want to set up their own shop but work under a major brokerage like compass or sotheby's or corcoran, etc, and they can run a team with unlicensed employees using that brand name. licensed salespeople cannot work on their own. in order to work the must have a managing broker/brokerage. there.is a hierarchy to it.   the answer to the 2nd part of your question is this...there are 2 sides of a deal/real estate transaction: the seller/landlord side and the buyer/renter side. each side can procure the assistance of an agent and their specific brokerage to either sell/rent out their property or buy/lease their new home. these relationships have fiduciary responsibilities to their specific client and none to the other side of the deal. if you are looking for.an apartment and you don't have your own specific representation/agent working on your behalf with fiduciary, responsibilities to you, everyone else you are talking to represents the sell/ll side and they owe you nothing. dual agency is not legal without disclosure and consent. i’d do month-to-month roommate setup for first month or 2, to orientate, find your feet, explore. lots of good answers here, gonna add don’t be afraid to look at boroughs outside of manhattan or even across the river in nj if your struggling with the apartment shuffle. i had two apartments in the city and recently relocated to the hudson valley and take the train in. the apartment finding process was night and day compared to the city.   i would also advise to avoid streeteasy and try hotpads instead. in my experience hotpads has better listings (found both my apartments in hp). and look for listings that say ‘no fee’ if you want to avoid brokers. best of luck! how much are you making? i went to the facebook housing pages and looked for sublets. stayed at a sublet for awhile, the original renter moved out and i wanted to stay so i took over the lease. it’s an easy way to never have to pay fees, assuming that you’re renting from an individual/family and not a massive management company. you look look a jersey city or harrison especially if you telework any days. consider just finding 'any ole place' that looks good enough for now.  once you're here for a year or two, you'll have a much better idea of the city, your commute, and what neighborhoods you like.  it might be more expensive in the long run, but i think the accuracy with which you could then, later, choose your neighborhood, and the experience you'll have with the renting process (as well as a better understanding of your budget), i think would increase your overall happiness with where you are.  and fwiw-  finding a place as a roommate is probably easier than finding a place straight up and then a roommate. there's downsides to that as well, i suppose. consider housing in the other boroughs. hi. i lived in manhattan for a long time. had a great deal on a rent stabilized apt….. some things in my life changed, so i decided to move into westchester. when i lived on 53 and 1st ave. i thought that was so far away.  however lots of people live in new rochelle. yonkers. pelham. etc. the metro north is 20 minutes to the city commute. i’m in my 40’s now and have a family so i don’t crave the night life like i did every night b4. however. westchester is cleaner, has done nice night spots, restaurants, pools, parks and other activities. i’m so glad i live here now.  apts can be rented for more reasonable prices, and instead of having a roommate you may be able to afford a one bedroom or studio on your own.  i love the spring, summer and fall months up here. it’s so beautiful.    well good luck. 🍀 lots of folks have provided you with good advice. i hope you will find a place you like that is affordable soon. wishing you the best. yes 40x rule is real but you can sometimes stretch if you have good credit etc  you can consider a corporate guarantor like ""the guarantors"" but not everyone takes them, and they're expensive  i moved for the job and presented my offer letter and letter from my boss explaining the bonus structure so i can get to 40x  brokers and agents bleh. find someone that'll show you around for the ""op"" that the apartment offers, that way you don't pay anything. or look for corporate owned buildings with their own leasing office, no fees at all that way you need to pay as little as possible your first two years. go in with roommates. you need a bed and a sub one hour commute. save save save. don’t be doing brunch every sunday etc. after two years you’ll maybe have enough to find a rent stabilized apartment or decent place way out like inwood or bay ridge to rent. 100k is like making 29k in cleveland. do the numbers. don’t sink yourself. check out long island city - plenty of luxury buildings with their own leasing offices (no broker fee), easy to get anywhere in manhattan, a beautiful park and the best views of manhattan in the city by the water, and units in your price range if you're making $150k. living in manhattan is overrated in my opinion, except for a handful of neighborhoods - too expensive, and a lot of the small, independent shops and restaurants that made it a great place to live have been priced out and replaced with starbucks or a chain drugstore. it's not worth it anymore. https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2024/06/03/apartment-hunting-tips-nyc.html  here’s some tips. you’ll need $5k up front at the minimum if you land something for $2.5k. you may owe a broker’s fee if you go that route, but i’d encourage you to avoid brokers as much as possible. no one can afford to live in nyc it’s not real lol good luck with credit too 😂😂 you need a 750 to live in the hood this place is horrible i will run and go to another state honestly i just lie about how much money i make when i apply for a new apartment yes you should make 40x rent. acceptable normal is whatever you determine to your financial situation rent stabilized can be v nice or now  .. and v hard to get … most are from someone you know booking you up in my experience… ( i have one for 27 years ) it’s a tough job market and overall economy. save as much as you can for the unexpected. you don’t need to use a broker. this is your first time living in the city, find a roommate so you have more spending money to use for activities and entertainment. the fidi area is pretty reasonable and has great options for shared apartments. you get more space in fidi compared to other areas of the city. best of luck! on streeteasy there’s actually a filter for “broker fee free” which can help you only look at apartments without them! i’ve lived in nyc for about 4 years & have never paid a broker fee. i’m also pretty lucky though & only had to move once as my current apartment is rent stabilized & i just keep renewing.   you can also move decently “cheap”. a u-haul & one or two guys off task rabbit will probably run you less than $500.  definitely take time learning the neighborhoods first if you can because once you sign a lease, if you hate that apartment or neighborhood you’re stuck there for a year.  always look at the apartment in person. i rented my first nyc apartment remotely (this was 2020) & the whole process was iffy (fortunately i wasn’t scammed or anything) but the apartment was much smaller than expected, had roach problems, bathroom was microscopic, etc. i counted down to my moving day for months.  congratulations on getting the big city job! if you have reasonable spending & can keep your living expenses under control you can still be pretty comfortable here. for the record my first 3.5 years here the most i made was $46k a year with two roommates. that was rough. changed jobs & now at $75k with two roommates & my qol has gone up a ton even though i work longer hours now. look for apt in staten island def cheaper than the city the 40x rule means that most landlords want to see you make 40x the rent. it does not mean you should literally make $100k and pay $2.5k. like please don't. you could make $100k and pay $1k rent. of course be cheap. especially since you're new. the city will eat you alive if you don't budget well.   roommates is a really good option. if you hate it, switch to living alone but at least you'll have experience here first   if you got a job contract stating your new salary, that's enough for many landlords you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. you will be fine and will fine something within your budget but it could take some time👍🏽 if money is a concern,look into jersey like hoboken or jersey city. you will save 4% from the nyc resident tax and rents are slightly lower than manhattan. your tax returns are mostly used to show you can hold a job and maintain steady income. usually good credit and an offer letter is enough to prove your income. don’t live in manhattan and accept the fact that nyc is expensive so act accordingly (cook mostly at home, public transportation, etc..) look at places in jersey city. cheaper, won’t need a roommate, can have a car if you have one and most likely will have to account taking the path train to the city. i live in jersey city with my brother $2690 rent per month. 3 bedrooms, 1bath, w/d, basement and backyard i would try to stick to 33% of your net income everyone saying that you need to have roommates- you are the reason why the rental market is the way it is. crowding with three of your friends in a small 3-bed in the east village while each of you make 100k+ because you want that “adventurous” nyc life. then you dip as soon as you have real obligations or have a kid. a bunch of 20s and 30s full grown adults living like college students. you make it impossible for people who grew up here who have families to survive. please go back to michigan or oklahoma or whatever. please. try southern brooklyn. you got the , f, n, or b/q lines. 90 percent of new yorkers can't really afford it but that's just normal. you make it work because it's new york. that's what it means to be a new yorker. you stick it out. enjoy the honor of having a job and living in nyc. that means eat well, have fun, look cute, and have good sex. this is the new york way move to nj like the rest of the people who get jobs in ny other people have answered your questions but to #4, always look up your building here (gives you a sense of how big/bad the landlord is): https://whoownswhat.justfix.org/en/ on #2, it’s all very circumstantial but i would argue the crowd in this thread is also the type of people who will buy the bullshit that brokers fee is a standard part of life ie corporate boys and girls.   tldr, it’s really not. you can find apts without these shit fees. fuck that shit. streeteasy literally has a filter for it. i left the city in 2019, was born and raised and lived there until my late 20's and outside of the city is just batty too. although prices might not be as crazy and you might more individual landlords instead of corporate management offices, we had to come ready to offer to sign for 2 years vs 1 when we finally were considered for an apartment. i feel for you so much. none of us can….yet here are are! good luck in your search! 🍀 can someone tell me why nyc is the only place (that i know of) where brokers’ fees are common for renters? it’s like insult to injury on top of the ridiculously high taxes and ridic cost of living. bro just live in the bronx and get stabbed. or live in westchester ave double your grocery bill. bonus is actual grocery stores in westchester instead of buying from the bodega based feline mafia. 1. some people pay at 40x. usually people your age honestly because they value being near nightlife more than other things. from my experience eventually people just want a nicer apartment and they move into queens/brooklyn and pay less. no one should pay 10k for an apartment unless it includes a pool. i make almost 200x my rent. but a lot of people don’t make enough money to be in that position. i like in a reasonably cheap apartment that is still nice. it’s 40x is still well above median income.   2. yeah it’s a lot to move in. i’m pretty sure brokers fees are capped now. but it’s still a lot of money. i was around 4.5x monthly rent on my last move for costs with all the fees and movers and cleaners and what not.   3. usually if you have a broker you tell them this. then they negotiate that issue for you. i usually send pay stubs. but you might need an offer letter if it’s very new.   4. yes and no. it depends on your lifestyle. i made under 20k the first 8 years i lived here. which the internet says is 27k today. i had a lot of roommates and i ate a lot of $1 pizza. my ex 5 years ago made 35k by choice (he had a well paying job he just did it very part time). that was the exact amount he needed to live. currently for my lifestyle i need around 200k, but if i lost my job i could make 150k work. i recommend not living at the extent of your salary so you have an emergency fund and what not.   5. depends on the apartment. things stabilized at low rents tend to not be very nice. if they were renovated to be nice they would have gone up in price. some apartments are actually stabilized at high numbers like more than the rent they charge. some of those are quite nice, but also they can raise your rent all the way to the stabilized number so it’s important not just to know it’s stabilized but what number it’s stabilized at. stabilized apartments are tough to find and have significantly more competition. they also aren’t as cheap as the media would have you believe. someone in a $500 stabilized apartment has been there for 20 years. i just checked street easy and most of them cost around what my current apartment costs. they do technically block rent raises, but you can also negotiate those if desired. yes, we really do pay that kind of rent. i pay $2500, and make more than $100,000.   roommates are your best option coming to the city, especially at that age (making certain assumptions about your income based on what 20-somethings usually make in the city).   you won’t be living in a posh manhattan apartment. you’ll need to likely check the other boroughs and less “desirable” neighborhoods.   yes, you need 3-4 months upfront for move in costs - 1 month security, first month rent, broker fee, and sometimes last month rent. i had to fork over $9500 just to secure my apartment. that didn’t include movers or any other moving expenses.   as for income verification, you provide tax documents and your offer letter as part of your application.   roommates can make a lot of this much, much more affordable. 1. yes. that’s for everyone in the household. most get roommates or partner if they make $100k or less. you can also elect to have a longer commute into manhattan (ex: jersey city) in exchange for cheaper rent.   2. broker fees suck. as a rule of thumb, you should have ~$10k for a move to cover first/last month rent and security deposit. then some for the broker. some moving company fees. it adds up. if the company wants you bad enough, they may cough up relocation fees.   3. get a letter from the employer with prospective income. i’ve seen landlords be lenient with this as long as your bank statements show that you have enough to cover if you lost your job.   4. roommates. living with family if you’re a native nyer.   things to watch out for: * assuming you won’t be bringing your car: make sure you have more than one way to get to work, whether it’s more than one train stop or one train stop and a bus that can take you to another train.  * the cost of living here is expensive. don’t forget to calculate the increased cost of food, laundromats, etc. * don’t fall for the “free month of rent” unless you plan on moving in a year. your rent will increase by that much next year.  * i can’t stress this enough but sooo many people here job hop because hiring happens just as frequently as layoffs do. if you survive july, goal is to make it to january.  if you survive january, try to hang on til april. seriously, make sure you build a nice fat emergency fund. welcome to new york, get ready to toughen up!  1 - are you asking what people realistically do or if that 40x rule is real? it's absolutely real, and there are people who pay much less than 40x if they're lucky or frugal, or much more if they're squeezed. i've paid 50% of my income to rent in the past.     2 - it's mostly brokers, and now this weird new breed of brokers who are in the business of finding you housemates. when i last looked for a place on my own, it was 1 month's rent or 15% of the yearly rent, which was negotiable. i don't know what it is now but if someone is asking 3-4 months, that's insane. i would not go with that broker unless negotiating brought them down a lot, and it was stabilized or some other guarantee i wouldn't be priced out of it within a couple years.  3 - i don't think they'll care about the income change, but yes those docs are common asks.  4 - if you're smart, determined yes. there's a lot more for you to know, but if you look enough you may encounter many other kinds of scams, rip-offs, lies, and bs. i could write a book on my experiences.  5 - it was stabilized if the building was built within a certain period. they are typically in bad condition because the landlord doesn't make enough to bother renovating it. weirdly enough i found myself in a decent rs apartment. they used to be all cheap, but now with the law change there are some more expensive ones. you find one with perseverance, luck, or taking over one from someone else. honestly, you sound like you make too much to be having one. let us more modest folks have them. these are def not dumb questions btw. it’s a real s**tshow since the lockdowns.   and rent stabilized apts. aren’t necessarily less pleasant, but it doesn’t mean they will never raise the rent. try queens too  astoria long island city  woodside sinnyside forest hills   all good areas i've lived in nyc for 8 years, in queens. i've never paid a broker fee-i've always just used street easy and looked at apartments without the fee. my apartments have mostly been rent stabilized too, which is not super hard to find if you're willing to go out to queens but might be harder elsewhere. you could also do a sublet at first so you can have more time to look around and figure out where you want to live. hey op, if your workplace is in manhattan you could even consider new jersey (that way you can avoid 3% new york city tax). commute from new jersey via train or bus is quite good (nyc subways can get nasty) and you get a better price per sq foot.   based on your workplace location, max rent & any special considerations (eg: do you want to have a car, do you have a hybrid work schedule) i can give you suggestions. i’ve lived in manhattan, brooklyn and different northern nj towns.  generally speaking: lower manhattan- best places are jersey city, hoboken, newport & harrison.(along the path transit)  midtown manhattan has a lot more options because of the port authority bus terminal & 34th penn station. $1,600/mo  cheapest out right now with a manhattan zip code.  check out this home on streeteasy: 479 west 146 street, manhattan

85,How much do you really need to make to live alone in NYC?,"you can do it with less if you have zero debt i’m sorry, what does “decent quality of life” mean? this going to be very different from person to person.   are you okay with an older (but still perfectly nice) walk up building in upper manhattan, non-trendy brooklyn, or queens? if so i think 100k is fine, i know people who do it with a bit less. it’s definitely harder than it was even a couple of years ago.  if you’re trying to live in a luxury building downtown or basically anywhere in north brooklyn (anything from prospect park on up) you’re going to need more obviously. 80k is enough. it will be comfortable maybe no savings tho. you can live ues, harlem fine i was lucky and able to find a rent stabilized studio apartment in east village for 1950. was there for 3 years and rent went up to around 2100. at the time, i was making around 90k and felt that it was doable. i make 99k and livin in ues 4th floor walk up paying $2500 a month. that's half of my paycheck. the quality of life is good but also means i can't save any money. lol what i’m starting to realize is reddit is full of transplants who live in nyc but don’t understand that nyc has rich people but the majority don’t make over 80k. rent stabilized apts is a thing. y’all wanna argue or disagree but a fact is a fact i’m born and lived her my whole life.   there are 1bd apts all throughout nyc for 1950-1750k you just gotta do some looking. [deleted] where in nyc? there’s a huge variance in prices i make around 62k and live in dyker heights. i have a big one bedroom apartment for around $1,513 - though i just got my lease renewal in the mail and it’s probably more than that.  i don’t have any debt, and don’t go out often. while there’s not a ton of money leftover each month, i do save a tiny bit. am i living large? not really, but i also don’t need much to be happy. i like to stay home and play video games or watch movies. the moment i step outside it feels like $100 has left my account haha.  when i first moved here i was also making around the same and lived in the bronx by yankee stadium. i had a one bedroom and was paying around $1,312. this was maybe 4 or 5 year ago. some of y’all are really tripping in this thread. sounds like you all need some form of discipline. i’m a 24 y/o female living in harlem. doorman, ac, in unit washer/dryer. i make 75k a year. i save about $500 every month, while also eating out about 4 times a week and while having a slight shopping and alcohol addiction. it’s all about budgeting. and you can live comfortably and budget at the same time, the two don’t coexist. the first month living alone, it will feel like your expenses are through the roof, but after the 2nd or 3rd month, it should ease up. depends on what you consider the city….  queens, bronx, staten island, and parts of brooklyn are vastly different than manhattan and desirable/ popular parts of brooklyn.  that said,  if the sun shines right and the stars align, you may get extremely lucky and find something in a walk up in manhattan for 2500 a month.  it may be best to hell and gross,  but it could get you there….  it would probably be about the same cost in less desirable areas but you would get more for your money.  at 100k a year that would amount to probably 1 check a month to rent and one check a month to everything else with really nothing much left to save depending on lifestyle. it depends where you are financially. do you have loans/cc debt? large medical expenses? if not or it’s minimal, then 100k is good as long as you have your rent at or under 2k. use online calculators to see your after tax (make sure it includes federal, state, and local taxes) stabilized studio in a luxury building in boerum hill is $2.1. i make $80k and i’m fine.  but i have no debt, good insurance, and i don’t have to travel far to see family. not having to fly home for holidays saves a couple hundo a year. [deleted] depends on what you want. for about a year, i lived alone in a $1,500 studio. it was quiet and in a nice building. that year, i made about 60k. i don't have too many expenses and don't live very lavishly, and i was able to live a decent life while still saving a bit of my income. you people are ridiculous, transplants should be banned from these threads. there’s plenty of apartments under 2k in upper manhattan, south brooklyn, queens. good safe neighborhoods. jesus christ 80k can get you something up to 2k which is doable in a lot of areas around the city.   i moved in to my apartment 5 years ago paying $1750 making about 70k. i was house poor but had to gtfo of my mom's house and did not want roommates. a lot of flight attendants live in queens. the definition of nyc  includes a lot of areas. people use guarantors, people have roommates, there are a lot of ways to get by. i was living alone (rent stabilized) pre war 1br in a sort of up and coming neighborhood on a 75k or a little less.  pretty comfortably. now i’m in the same apartment earning closer to 100k and having my partner pay a portion of rent ….and i feel poorer than before. i have more expensive insurance at my new job, i’m paying student loans again, and have a monthly laptop payment, my insurance is more expensive and has higher copays. so i feel like i’m struggling when i shouldn’t be. but if i had to pay rent alone again i would manage. no oneeeee can answer this for you. jesus christ. sit down and make a budget. to live nicely/comfortably, which means you are also saving some money for retirement or to one day purchase a home, **you should make 50x your monthly rent** -- period.  so, as long as you are ok with a $2,000/month apartment, a $100k income is perfectly fine.  the calculation is an easy one.  anyone who is telling you that 40x is acceptable is not wanting to mention that you can barely afford your lifestyle at that level (that's not just my opinion; it's the opinion of all landlords). brooklyn, $2400 rent, 100k salary the below is for manhattan. but new york is a big place and there are four other boroughs, most of which, except for western brooklyn, are significantly cheaper. also people get pretty touchy when people ask this so you should expect some hostility.   for manhattan:  it depends what sort of sacrifices you’re willing to make. and it’s more of a spectrum.   if you don’t care about the neighborhood, quality of apartment, having a bunch of roommates, and needing to be disciplined about what you spend when you go out, i’d say you can probably make it on almost any salary.   if you want to live in a nice neighborhood, nice apartment, don’t want roommates, want a 1br, and don’t want to have to penny pinch when you go out, i’d say 120+ probably.   i wouldn’t live in manhattan if i was making less than 100k. i’m making 150-175k, definitely fit into the second category i mentioned, and i’m saving about 1k/month. so not struggling at all but my savings should be much higher given my income, so definitely having to make a sacrifice. according to abc news reported, at least $138k had a roommate and paid 2.6k each for a luxury high rise 2 bed in hk on ~ 110k back in 2021, though this was a covid deal and was rent stabilized for each lease. when we left last year due to life circumstances the rent went up by $1500, so probably not an accurate representation of today’s market.   now i pay around 3k on a 180k salary for a rent stabilized 1 bed in williamsburg with nice amenities like w/d in unit, gym, lounge, rooftop, manhattan views, etc. def not the norm and units in my building are snatched up within days, but i certainly feel comfortable enough. paying like 4k for rent just feels bad no matter how much you make. i pay 2300 for a new building in mott haven. gym, in unit w/d , dishwasher and a pool during the warm months. i on paper make $70k but work overtime and last year made $110k. i have 1 kid and i take 2-3 vacations a year. don’t really stress about money. job offers a pension but i save about $1k a month for retirement.  in no way rich obviously. eat out 3-4 meals a week not including about $15-$20 for lunch every day. uber every week avg about $100/week. don’t go out to eat often maybe 1-2x a month. no pet. for a studios? you can make it with 70-80k depending on if you are willing to live outer parts of outer boroughs. 100k is 100% more than enough and more than most people's combined house hold incomes. for manhattan? a lot lot tougher but possibly, just not a great studio. 85k base salary and 1900 lol i make half that and live alone and able to save a lot every month. i just live way below my means and very frugal yet can treat myself when i want to. 1 billion bro, if medical residents can make living in the city with 66k work (me) you can have a great life in nyc with 100k single in safe-ish areas. just as long as you know how to have fun without ordering out and drinking excessive bougie cocktails, and don’t want to pay excessive rent to hide away the fact that poverty exists in this city and actually close to you. this is going to be different for everyone because people have different expenses and priorities. i moved out when i was making $70k but i moved into a rent stabilized one bedroom for $1350. i make a little more now and my rent has gone up about $60? but i do not want to live in a luxury building or anything so keeping my rent under $2k is my goal for as long as possible i do it on $50,000 a year. $2300 rent. it’s tight. i don’t save or invest much. but i’m also young so not a pressing concern at this moment. i’m starting a job in brooklyn next july looking for an apartment in brooklyn in bushwick or close to it i will be get paid 80k and i’m outside the country and looks no chance to find  a one bedroom apartment close to 2k a month 💔 depends where. if you’re going to be in manhattan (not upper manhattan like in wood) then you’re looking at 3k+ for a 1 bed room. gentrified brooklyn is also stupid expensive.  in the bronx you’ll find places that are below 2k but it’s the bronx (i’m from the bronx so i get to say that)   best bang for buck is queens. you can find 1 bedrooms in rego park in the 2k range , forrest hills. and if you’re latin, then you’ll love jackson heights.   pro tip- look for spots on facebook marketplace. do your due diligence and watch out for scams but k found my apartment through there. paying 1750 currently.  also i laugh at the people that say 100k isn’t enough. bro, look at the median income for nyc, it’s nowhere near that. the mfs that say that are the ones that want to live in the most expensive areas and eat out every day. if you can’t live more , more than comfortably on 100k by yourself, you got issues when i started living alone here about 20 years ago, i’d just gotten a raise to i believe about 80k. i was able to ditch roommates, but it wasn’t easy. the city is as expensive as you want to make it—i net over four times now than i did then, but i’ve never felt wealthy. i make $80k, get $10k bonus and do some odd jobs here and there so i make a little over $100k a year so i'm ok but my life style is very low key and boring lol in my opinion $70,000 at the very bottom but you will need to make sacrifices on space and location (live in outer boroughs, stay away from expensive neighborhoods, further from subway, walkups, etc.) and keep a tight budget. well $2000 for rent. so you need $24,000 a year for rent only. depends on what you mean by decent quality of life  if you prioritize & budget well it’s totally doable  i make around 80k, live in a studio in uws, and save around 1-2k a month outside of my 401k. i spend a lot on things i care about and ruthlessly cut out anything i don’t new york city ranks first overall, requiring an income of $138,570 for a single person to live comfortably.   https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/salary-single-person-needs-to-live-comfortably-in-major-us-cities.html rent is 1900 ues covid deal making above 100 who else is here from r/circlejerknyc ? i’m so confused by this. there are tons of brooklyn apartments for 2k or less ??? at least 90 mili under that you on the subway, prison shelters, or rikers you can do it on 65-70k. i'm in school now, but i made 62k and i felt like i made enough to live alone if i really wanted to (i also have no debt). i think it just depends on your personal comfort level and life situation.

100k is doable for sure! especially if you don’t have other debt like student loans. the exception is if you have any physical disabilities that require an elevator/ada compliancy. those apartments are going to be in pricier buildings.   as for decent quality of life, that’s so subjective. it’s nyc, so you’re not going to easily find apartments with dishwashers and washer/dryers at that budget. and at a budget reasonable for that income, around 2k, you’re going to probably have a modest sized apartment in a non-trendy neighborhood. if you’re somebody wants to live in a nice, spacious place with all the amenities, 100k isn’t going to do it. but if you’re somebody who loves the city and just needs a clean, safe place to sleep at night 100k is more than enough. if you win a housing lottery or live with parents. i mean if you want real space (non-typical ny space) when i first moved here i was making 50k and i found a cheap little studio in crown heights. knew someone moving out so i got it. just have to look beyond streeteasy you need to be making no less than $8k a month to live “comfortably” in nyc provided you have no kids. its only going to get worst though so i honestly would suggest living in newark, hoboken, union city, etc and working in ny if you wanna survive what i’m learning here is that you need to make a list of your own priorities and look into general costs for those! cause we have people here saying that 3k/month after all living expenses isn’t enough to live comfortably but you have others making 3k/month after taxes saying they live comfortably.   if you want the big city feel and to eat out every meal and to have access to all entertainment in the city then it probably isn’t enough. if you’re willing to live in literally any other borough, cook yourself breakfast or eat at bodegas more often, and like going to the movies as much as broadway i think you’re fine! to live in manhattan “comfortably”, let’s say east village, i would say around $125k. do people here ever lived in nyc? there's plenty of good 1bd options in brooklyn and upper manhattan for under $2000. 100k is more than enough and you won't need to live paycheck to paycheck.   i know plenty of people living comfortably with 50~70k/year. just get a place outside the main area of manhattan (financial district up to harlem). this thread is ridiculous. even if you limit your search to studios in manhattan, you’ll find places for $1,600/month—and that’s just on streeteasy, not some special insider’s deal.  for that rent, you need to make $64k/year at least. you’re already living comfortably in that scenario, because you’re living alone. it’s a bonus that you’re in nyc and that you have  access to great food, culture, or whatever it is that you crave.  i don’t know. when i graduated, i rented a room, and i felt pretty lucky about my setup. that was $24k/year or $45k/year in today’s money.  if you’re lucky enough to be making $100k/year, you have options. you don’t have to spend everything you have on rent. dip your toe in, and then upgrade after you’ve gotten the lay of the land. i make a smidgen over 100k/year. my rent is $2350/month (excluding broker's fee). i live in a studio/small one bedroom in a neighborhood near downtown brooklyn. i'm living comfortably, although not saving as much as i would like in a perfect world. i made like 120k last year and i have a cheap mortgage on my home ($1500 a month) and i feel like i’m drowning lol anywhere from $1000-$1500 minimum depending on your lifestyle  eta those numbers represent weekly take home if you have a market rate apartment i’d say about 80k.  and that’s having a no frills studio / 1 bd apartment that’s probably in an older building in one of the outer boroughs and not very close to manhattan.  those places start at around 2k and you wont have a bunch left over for routinely going out / traveling / saving, but if you budget correctly, you’ll be able to live somewhat comfortably. seeing a lot of responses caveated with ""no savings"". as a lifelong nyer living solo, i would say $150-175k minimum to live comfortably and if you're renting.  and by comfortably i mean: a decent pick of neighborhoods across manhattan e.g. any of the villages, little italy, c-town, etc. with rents between $2.5-3.5k depending on what you want (only the really high end hoods like tribeca would be off-limits unless you had a partner imo or you are a millionaire). barring any significant debts, you could eat out a lot, have more than enough disposable income, have a gym membership with tmpl or even equinox, and put away a good portion into savings.  in a nutshell, your finances are clean and healthy and you have an above average salary. i say all this from experience. feel free to ask questions. 185 billion but you need to be mindful of the safe withdrawal rate so as not to spend the principal. it depends on how much you care about location. honestly. are you cool with being in harlem? there are some nice apartments there. if you have to be in the center of the action as a young person (the village) you’re going to get hosed last year i lived alone in queens, $2k rent for a 1 bedroom, $70k salary, no debt. life was good (could afford dinners out with friends, trips upstate, gifts for people etc.), but i could not afford to travel further, and i did not save anything.   my job was contributing 12% to my 401(k) though, and i’m fully vested you need to make 40x the monthly rent and have good standing credit. having money to show for in your checking and savings account are a plus and can count up to 20% of your annual salary. depends on your lifestyle and fixed expenses. i support my elderly parents financially and have a pretty high maintenance dog, so adding that with more frequent international travel to an otherwise pretty normal lifestyle, i’d say $225k. otherwise i think $175k minimum to live in an actual decent neighbourhood of manhattan. but i’m relatively new to the city, so i’m sure other more experienced locals would have better general numbers. what kills it (obviously), is the rent here, i’ve lived in a few big cities across the world but that extra couple of grand rent in manhattan really screws with the finances. i used to be a 25-30% saver/investor, and now i’d be lucky if it’s 20%. so that’s not ideal. but don’t forget this is the city where networking and being a local can actually grow your income faster than anywhere else. so if you can stay in a small studio somewhere in the city and upskill to a better number, it might end up being a better choice than moving out. moving away from nyc always felt like a downgrade to me. ues, $2,410 rent, $135k salary i lived pretty comfortably on $75k until the housing market went nuts last summer and my apartment went up $500 in rent in 2 years. but i'm not a big spender. i prefer to make most of my meals, ate out 2 or 3 times a week, and i'm not a drinker so my costs were pretty low. at least $150k-175k, if i max out my retirement with emergency funds and while paying <3k for rent.  this isn't without saving for a future home while being able to travel multiple times a year and have monthly leisure activities without pinching pennies, you know live life.  if saving for a home, then the ball game changes especially with high prices and mortgage rates are.  also not counting the combined finances of a partner. i’d say 200k. i make 150k and feel “ok” and that’s with a cheap rent of $2,500, maxing out my 401(k), and no debt.  one paycheck covers all of my expenses and the remaining paycheck is for fun and food. factoring in going out, dinners and drinks and random things, i’d say i’m saving 30-50% of the remaining paycheck. 100k is doable, but it depends on your debt, spending habits and what you’re investing in, i guess. i’m doing okay in a 1 bedroom in queens on 100k. i own though but was able to save up for the down payment. my monthly mortgage and maintenance are only 1700. i live in a 1br in gv for $3200/mo. if you can afford $40k a year on rent+utilities+broker fees then there are lots of options for you. my 1 bed in ridgewood is 1800. it’s a basement, but that’s fine with me. minimum of $3,500/mo assuming you don't have any debt you're paying off and all your money is going straight to you, yes 100k could be enough lived in nyc for over a decade, single/living alone for part of the time. in my opinion, it’s more than enough for a good quality of life. but what that means depends on how much you like to ball out. as others have mentioned: are you set on living in manhattan or would you consider borough-life? are you trying to dine out every night? do you like to take lots of expensive vacays? will you be paying to park a car? no matter how much you make, your qol boils down to budget and lifestyle! a bajillion dollars it’s all about timing, (or being able to wait) let’s say you can move in with a roommate for 1000-1500, in the meanwhile search every day day and night for the keyword “rent stabilized” on street easy. they day you find it you’ll pray hard it doesn’t go before you and call the landlord / agent right away. i think what happens is when people move to new york they just have to find a place right away. that’s what’s available at the market. if you can wait, there is pretty good chances i pay 2000 in midwood $7k monthly with a rent in manhattan midtown. a girl of 22 yo, a ukrainian refugee maxing out my retirement, not contributing to healthcare (lucky and single - my colleagues with families contribute a bunch), and with significant student loan debt ($700/month payments probably forever lol.)  i feel very comfortable paying $2,600 (for a small 2 bedroom in a neighborhood i love, that’s pretty deep in bk, albeit trendy, and a tough commute from work) at between $150k and $200k. i got a late start on retirement (and finally have an employer who matches) so am investing heavily now which definitely makes a big dent in my take home. i’ve also paid down all of my credit card debt in the last year after almost a year and half of unemployment during covid (yay startups!)   i’m not much of a (clothes) shopper but i buy more candles than i should, treat myself to flowers once a week, order in a lot, do the majority of my shopping at the farmers market, and dont limit myself when going out (generally once every other week now because i’m old lol.) i don’t travel a ton (outside of work travel) but do visit family in other parts of the us a few times a year and do a big international trip every few years (airbnb style, but still upwards of $5k all in.)   i’m prepared to pay $3k in rent to move closer to my office and/or in rent increases over the next two years but anything more than that would feel like a big stretch with my loan payments and without changing my lifestyle significantly. i cannot imagine having a child and paying for daycare/a nanny in park slope with my income. it’s absolutely possible (i grew up in the bronx and make more money now than my dad ever did supporting a family of 4) but it’s not something i would choose. depends what ur other expenses are 100-125 should be enough if you manage rental expense well net or gross? bay ridge brooklyn, $1760 rent, $93k $50k if. you plan to live/work long term in the 5 boro’s buy a condo! or you just pay 3-4 thousand a month😂it’s bad in north jersey now too jersey city,weehawken, hoboken etc. ,rent&gas prices for me, i would think about 120+, but i only make 85k so i bought a house in nj. i live in manhattan dolo and make about $175k a year. i make 70k plus commission and it’s enough to pay bills and have something left over i make $63k and live in a $1900/month studio. it does put me in a tough spot, cutting it pretty close monthly and living paycheck to paycheck, but i make it work. thinking of moving in with a roommate once my lease here is over though (i’m 31 though, and that somewhat feels like i’m going backward…) two bedroom in n brooklyn. about 1800. make a 105k even if you find a decent rent in nyc, the cost of literally everything else has gone up so much. i’m in a 2 income household of about 100k and it’s honestly not enough. i don’t see myself ever being able to buy a house, but hopefully i can buy a condo in the future. i am born and raised in brooklyn, you can’t price me out! 100k, minimum if you want to live 40 mins from downtown. 65-80k if you can handle 1.5hr commutes each way. i made $75k and did it, not horrible 100k i live in south jamaica and got a big 3 bedroom 2 bathrooms and only pay 2800 a month the answer to this question really boils down to where you're willing to live and in what kind of apartment.  $100k is more than enough to live alone, but if you want a 1-br and space and amenities, you may need to accept you'll be farther out in queens or brooklyn and likely not in manhattan.  i have a 1-br in manh (and make $100k) but i've been there 17 years, its the top floor/5th floor walk-up and the building isnt great (nor the neighborhood); no laundry in the building, shower only, etc.  but i value a short commute above all, and pet-friendly next, so i sacrifice in other things.  also, i dont go out a lot (homebody type) so my money isnt spent on restaurants or bars, shows or movies or events.  if you spend a lot of money on going out or travel, a smaller place may do you- just a storage locker with a bed, my friend calls her place.  if you want a lot of rolm at home for hobbies or working from home or guests, etc, then that also altera where you can rent.  and if you have debt (student loans, medical bills, etc) take into consideration how much that takes of your paycheck.  if you spend some time figuring out what matters most to you, there are tons of places $100k will do you absolutely fine here.  however, keep in mind you cant have everything, so pick your top 3.  also, remember to leave yourself money to put away for emergencies- do t budget so you're liyerally leaving jothing for the unexpectd.  this city is full of surprises, bith good and bad.  a friend just lost her apartment because the construction on the building next door to hers dug too far under her building's foundation, and now her building has been condemned!  sadly, stories like this are not as uncommon as you would think.  so always be prepared for the possibility of life going sideways and neeeding money to deal with it.  good luck!! 160k+ especially if you’re even thinking of living in manhattan. 100k i would suggest the bronx were the new buildings are which is close to 125st in manhattan, grab one now before it gets out of hands like brooklyn are you the same person from my local fb group that's asked this a few days back lol i make $78k and live on the ues in a studio where my rent is $2200 so can anyone survive down there making minimum wage or is it completely impossible and if so, where do all the people live that do work minimum wage jobs down there? it doesn’t really make sense to me. come live in arverne in the rockaways. you’re close to the beach, rent is about 2k for a 1 bedroom. and the a train is walking distance. stones throw away from bk. you can also take the ferry which has shuttle service. you can live on like 70-80k in bronx easy so based on my apartment and rent. the legal guidelines say to live here i need to make 100k. the previous apartment i was in the answer was 53k. that apartment was pretty slummy though and i wouldn’t have said it was “decent”. i could have had a cheaper apartment with the same quality between the two prices.   i personally don’t think 40x rent is actually enough in most cases, especially in lower numbers. i personally feel more comfortable with my rest being less than 1/3rd of my monthly take home.   i make significantly higher than both the above numbers. but i’ve lived alone since i was making around 140k. and most of that has been decent.   i also live a 30-45 minute commute into brooklyn because prices close are unreasonable. i'd personally keep roommates at only 100k tbh. after taxes, insurance, and 401k, you're going to take home less than half of it. i love getting triple taxed in an expensive city lmao. 200 and you can have a studio that isn't a shithole so keep grinding 100k is more than enough to live alone. no and if you have to ask…. it’s been true for past few decades (i vaguely remember this annual salary cutting it but that may have been the 80’s) at least 70-85k as a single person imho it is largely dependent on which part of nyc. manhattan will be tough with $100k salary but you can prob find a studio. good credit and 80k will get you a shitty studio harlem/heights bronx or in brooklyn/queens   if you want a well apportioned clean apartment in a safe neighborhood close to the subway in manhattan - you need 115-130k i’m struggling in south slope on a 75k salary; i would really recommend you not move here with anything less than a 110k salary a year. things add up fast, and you have to pay for literally everything here $100k if you don't order out, go to bars, buy nice clothing, don't own a car lol i can go on. in the city (which refers to manhattan) most places will require that you earn 40x the rent (unless you have a guarantor, but assuming you don’t). so even if you wanted to be rent heavy, you’re going to be capped at $2500 on 100k salary. so you’ll likely be in a studio or if you want a one bedroom you’ll have to find more affordable areas like harlem. it can definitely be done. but $2500 will not get you a luxury one bedroom apartment with a doorman in the city. if you expand to other boroughs you can get more buck, except certain parts of brooklyn which are just as if not more expensive. born and raised new yorker, i make about 95-110k a year (sales) and even for about 2k a month, i don’t think i’m getting my money’s worth. jc has almost double the space for the same amount of rent. that’s a very broad question. it depends on multiple factors such as whether or not you have any debt, how much you spend, and what you consider to be a “decent“ quality of life. if you’re definition of a decent quality of life includes an apartment in the village, williamsburg, or the upper east side, that’s going to be vastly different from say living in one of the boroughs. 100k plus what are school teachers making in ny? $80k.  when i moved to nyc over 5-7 years ago, i was able to live comfortably on $65k while living alone and i was paying $1250 for a studio. the studio in same area is around $1600.    i was living in midwood, brooklyn.  i was willing to sacrifice and live in less desirable area among young folks and travel about an hour for work. $140k to be comfortable 50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times 20000000999999900000000000000000000 $100k is bare minimum in manhattan 6 figures with 100k i’d live in brooklyn or queens (commute can be 20 mins) or try to find a rent-stabilized studio if i must live in manhattan. i know some people who have found nice studios in hells kitchen, etc. for under 2500 (can’t recall if there was an income cap though of around 100k). realistically i’d have roommates. its not uncommon for people earning 200-300k to still have roommates here this apartment in woodside, looks comfortable, though not modern.  you can afford it on a $80,000/year and probably comfortably afford it at $90,000/year.  it’s a lot easier if you have a significant other you can split the rent with.   but i guess that wouldn’t be living on your own.  https://streeteasy.com/building/37_52-62-street-woodside on tv, nyc 1st responders & the working stiffs, live in staten island. 😉🤣 i've made between 65k-95k while living in nyc. i have kids, but i've been ""ok"" at these incomes. and by ok i mean - i don't have anything in my 401k, but i've never struggled for food. i had a place to rent, my kids had childcare although i had someone helping to pay 50% of that. i do go out every now and then and when working, i've never needed to borrow money for anything unless something major happened. the thing is, at 65k you can only rent an apartment that is worth 1625/month, which would likely be a studio. if you're ok with that, you should be ok. the thing is, i don't eat out much, i mostly use public transportation to get anywhere i need to go. at one point i did buy a car, but insurance for mine has tripled. so if i were in ny now that would not be doable. however - i will say, the neighborhoods i've lived in were neighborhoods where i would not be surprised to hear guns or see my block closed down for ""police activity"". i don't mind it because i grew up in those neighborhoods, but apparently some people are scared to live in such an area. if you’re lucky to get a good apartment. my friend died then u can live alone for 40k move to ohio its cheaper thats what native new yorkers are doing buying up all the farms and megahouses in ohion...sine we all worknfrom home....gelecommute from ohio....cheaper housing..cheaper taxes.....no crime. 90k and up, anything below that doesn’t really allow you to live on your own infinite money glitch i’m just living and somehow making it just double your rent dipshit 200k, 400k+ if you got a full blown family 150k the fact some of you guys fine and find it acceptable to live in a place without a kitchen is wild to me. i'd consider a kitchenless apartment as uninhabitable.  tell me your parents didn't prepare you to live outside the home on your own without telling me.... you can live in manhattan alone on a reasonable income, the heights and inwoods have some good deals. if you live in a decent (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen) place that's around 1,200/month you need to make 48k to qualify. standard pricing is a little over 1k/room.  i make 60k and have plenty to go out to eat for lunch and buy my lattes every day while saving 500 a month and putting into retirement.   regular people live and thrive here. o i make about 160k and rent is 1800 in queens 30 minutes from manhattan. 100k is enough to live comfortably enough to save, but it’s not enough to live extravagantly.   generally the financial rule is that your rent/mortgage should be a maximum of 25% of your monthly take home, but given nyc’s hcol, the rule can be more flexible depending on if you have a guarantor. nyc housing has the 40x rule for a reason as far as apartment qualifications. i’d say you really only get into that “picturesque nyc life” once you start getting to $120k or more if you’re paying $2k for a place 100k is enough for sure. 80k a year if u live humbly u can still go out and enjoy life, ubereats, etc at a normal rate depends what you want out of the city. i apartment hunted last year and found terrible apartments in cooler neighborhoods (bushwick, bed-stuy, astoria, etc) with ok prices. ended up not choosing any apts there because i didn’t want to live unhappy in a tiny/shitty apartment and still pay a lot of money.   i prioritized a good apt in a quiet neighborhood near bars, restaurants, stores, shops, etc without breaking the bank. ended up living in bay ridge alone on 95k and paying $1700 for a 2br. it’s far from the “cool places” but good enough for me and has a great quality of life. i live in brooklyn, i make $90k and pay $2150 for rent. my studio is tiny but it’s enough for me and my cat. i save half my paycheck (biweekly) and put that towards rent with $1000 leftover per paycheck. that’s a good quality of life… unfortunately i have debt to pay off so a good chunk of that leftover money goes to paying off that debt + paying utilities ($100-150 for electric, my heat and hot water, i think,  runs on electric and then $72 for internet). budgeting is key though $1,200 a day minimum question entirely depends on your definition of ""decent quality of life"".  imo, would say $100k is a good comfort zone where you can rent a $2-2.3k walkup 1br in a semi-trendy neighborhood like astoria/crown heights/ridgewood/harlem/whatever and still have money left over for fun and savings.   you can prob make $70-80k work but the budget will definitely feel tight.  if you insist on a luxury building in the hypertrendy neighborhoods like downtown manhattan/williamsburg, then you get the 250-300k figures that people are throwing out here. $170,000.00/yr i don’t think 100k is enough. i make about that and don’t think  i could live here if i didn’t split expenses with my gf. i’d say 180k is about around where you could live alone comfortably in any part of the city probably at least $130k to live comfortably. i make 100k a year and still feel like it ain’t enough. someone once said to me that nyc is fun if you make a lot of money or make no money. if youre in between it’s terrible. and after 3 years here, i can 100% confirm. yes 100k is enough. years ago but i lived by myself on 65k. may not be the case now. 80k salary to live comfortably and not in the ghetto 200k at least i think people overestimate how much you need to make. i’ve lived around the city for 15 years and i’ve never made more than 60k. right now i’m living with my girlfriend, so our combined income is a little over 100k. it’s probably the nicest place i’ve had, but for comparison the first year i was living in the city in my own apartment i only made 12k (these were the struggle years). if you’re frugal and have some hustle i know people living alone for way less than 100k; you’re not going to be close to anything and you’re going to have to work harder to find a place but it’s possible. 100k just gets you there barely. you'd need to find an apartment that you could actually rent on 100k, and in most of the desirable neighborhoods it'll be tough to find a studio for 2500 rn.   120-140k is where you need to be to live comfortably by yourself, though at that point you're not saving much. like 70k 1bd in some areas is 1750 i want to live in greenwich village for one month. all i need is a bed and a bathroom and permission to bring a dorm fridge and a microwave. (or kitchen privileges.) how much would that cost? 1 million dollars 🤑 comfortable living in nyc as a single-payer starts at $250k/ y. if you make less, you’ll have to cut corners or suffer from predatory landlords in poorly maintained buildings. certainly need minimum 100k and it can work if you don't have large other debt payments. to live relatively comfortably and not just survive? easily $130-$150k a year. living under a bridge? 40k   the rats be charging nowadays i make between $70,000-$110,000 and i have a 1 bedroom in queens for $1,900 i wouldn’t attempt it on less than $80k. i know people doing it on around $70k to $75k and it’s always a looks like stones throw from struggling. if you look hard enough and are okay without a dishwasher and w/d, 120k. 100k and you’re going to feel very skinny after groceries, utilities,and daily activities, with nothing to save. i live alone in downtown manhattan, make 100k, and feel like i have a decent quality of life. i don't save as much as i'd like and i'm not a big spender but if i'm responsible i don't feel strapped for cash. i managed a great deal of $2200 for a 1/bed, which i'm very grateful for and i know is rare, but it shows there are ""affordable"" places out there.   i do feel like 100k is the lower limit though. not impossible on say 85k, but i think it would be pretty difficult.  edit: zero debt, no dependents, good health, etc. shit would be real different for a lot of folk due to causes beyond their control i was approved for my $1,500 studio apartment making $66k base salary in 2018. that same studio is now $1,800 x 40 = $72k salary to get approved. $100k is doable, but won’t leave room for much especially if you’re in debt. when i started making 120k i felt comfortable paying 3k a month for a studio in a luxury apt (in lic) if you are approved for rent - on a 100k salary, i would think you can find a modest (read: small) studio for $1800 or so maybe on the ues. as long as you shop smart for groceries and don’t eat out every night, you should be fine! it depends on what you mean by ""decent quality of life""  i live in a non-trendy (aka far out) part of the city. i live a comfortable life (for me). others would say its not a decent life if you need to ride 45 min to get manhattan. lol no, try for $120k+. this will ensure you can afford a $3k studio if you're working or studying in southern manhattan or brooklyn, i think the most economical thing you can do is actually to live in jersey city near one of the path stations. commute will take 25-45 minutes, but the rent is a lot cheaper. my place was just under 1k every month, so i was doing fine and i was nowhere near six figures. i make 130k pay 3.3 k and live alone in a studio to live decent and comfortable from my experience, about 4.5-6.5k a month bcuz rent is ridiculous. that’s if you wanna live alone, if you get roommates then 3-4k a month splitting rent 3-4 ways depends on the borough and depends on the neighborhood for the borough ur interested in.   for example, i currently live in east elmhurst near the airport where the rent ranges from 1400-1850 for a 1 bedroom and about 2k-2.5k a 2/3 bedroom.   however, my sister lives in astoria, average 1 bedroom starts at 1860$, studio about 1400-1600k, 2 bedroom 2.3k. (but also astoria has a lot of stabilized apartments, so if ur lucky you can get one).   my bestie lives in lic, 1 bedroom starts averagely around 2.1k-3k depends on the building in lic. (but this is if ur near the park).   my dad lives in the rego park/corona/forest hills area. in corona, you can find 1 bedrooms for 1600-1800. but also consider the quality of these apartments.  in corona also depends if ur near the mall or in lefrak, then the prices jump to 2.1k, 2.3k  in forest hills, you can find a decent 1 bedroom starting around 1850.   flushing- especially by the skyview mall i actually decent quality and good size apartments for 1650$, 1700-1850$. these were a mix of a 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom.   these numbers are what i encountered when i was apartment hunting about 6 months ago.  so all in all, to live comfortable in nyc, u have to be making a minimum of 150k.   to live decent, like i consider myself- minimum 70k and higher up to 100k. on a strict budget because u never know with this city lol. they probably gonna charge breathing tax soon.   however, i must say, i live alone and my landlord is my cousin who gives me a break on the rent, that’s why i can afford to live decently on a yearly budget of approx 70k. and still go on vacations and hang out with my friends. if you make 70k or lower u can’t afford it unless maybe it’s a basement apartment but even then. i'm pretty spendy and i spend 35k a year on non rent. maybe that figure will help. includes multiple international vacations a year and eating out every meal i live alone in a one bedroom apartment in queens (approx 750 sq ft) and rent is approx 1800 a month. i get by making around 79k. definitely overshooting… you don’t need 100k salary. if you even make 4k a month you can find decent one bedrooms… making $8k a month is insane and wayyyy over any apartment needed. look at luxury apartments if you’re making that much i live in chinatown/nolita for 1750/month in a small 1bd, fifth floor walk up, no laundry machines. make 80k plus some small side gigs. am very comfortable! contribute to my 401k, hsa, and investment portfolio. i also travel cheaply twice a year, and though i do meal prep a lot, i eat out two three times a week. i have a cat. i am happy! and it’s really not that hard to keeps costs low too, though i am lucky with my rent and don’t have debt or a car. but i would not say that you’re in shambles if you’re not making 100k like some of these people lol. i got my apt on craigslist for 1250. it’s a pre war tho, floors kinda beat up but not really. would not complain look at your monthly paycheck, take 30% of that. thats your max rent. look at the market rates and back into the income requirement. at least 5 mil / year. 4 mil maybe doable if you cut on housing costs and luck out with a rent stabilized studio in east new york. 100k is enough but you won’t be saving a lot $2k on $94k base on 94th & 2nd if you want to live in a safe neighborhood, i’d honestly say 125,000 is the lowest, so more like 150,000.  you can honestly find some apartments for less than 2750 on the uws or ues, and i’m sure the same can be said for some of brooklyn’s nicer areas.  i don’t really know too much about rent prices in queens, but i’d guess astoria has some “affordable” units that actually have a decent amount of space. about 100k-$110k. i have a $2,500/mo apartment, car, health insurance, etc. can live cheaper on your own for sure though. things will be a little tight even with this salary however. how do you define quality of life? that’s the answer. about $4k monthly for me. 1 bdrm all utilities included $1500 and new tuscon truck car note is $649 each month and the rest of the bills are easy peasy. i don’t think you can really narrow it down enough to a general amount. each individuals needs and expenses are different so. i live in nyc making $60k. i have a roomate tho to split rent with. but anything is possible if you set your mind to it 100k? sure. if you want to rent a closet. i make 160k and personally wouldn’t live alone. i could technically afford it, but i don’t think it’s worth the cost for somewhere decent. most people ik living alone are making more than me, getting parent help, or live in neighborhoods further out 600-650k/y, live in my own condo with mortgage 4500/month (1.5 years since buying with 20%, so mostly paying interest) 300k at the very least",215,440,neutral,0.5435146689414978,655,"do you have any nice building. if you have debt, then 100k is fine as long as you have rent nice building. i would recommend a rent nice building. if you have debt, then 100k is fine. if you have large medical expenses, then 100k is fine. i would recommend a rent a or quality of life? but......"
86,I just want a studio in Queens. ,"im with you ! theres an affordable housing lottery near me that opened upon and the range is $30k-200k. why on earth do people making $200k need units reserved for them?? they already have easier access to more units!! where are you looking at? looking in sunnyside on streeteasy there are 13 rentals right now that meet your exact requirements… [deleted] hey, i did a super quick search and found two in queens under 2k. there were more. here are the ones that looked good at first glance:  https://www.padmapper.com/apartments/new-york-ny/l-3188833p/studios/under-2000?box=-73.92721,40.72628,-73.87949,40.7892   https://www.padmapper.com/apartments/new-york-ny/l-23102759p/studios/under-2000?box=-73.92721,40.72628,-73.87949,40.7892 there’s plenty of studios in the 2000-2500 range even on the upper east side. i’m confused as to how that can’t be found in queens. i have a large 1 bedroom in queens for less than $2400 with electricity and gas included in the rent. found it last summer.   where are you looking that you aren’t able to find a studio for $2500 in queens? perhaps search further east. i really be feeling for yall people in nyc man, like i understand it’s expensive to live in the city but what’s going on up there for rent is just fucking wrong man. but in proud of you for getting your shit together. that shit ain’t easy hm. i’m going to echo other commenters here and say that maybe there is something going on with your search parameters. a studio or 1br in queens near good transport shouldn’t be hard to find under $2500.  my partner and i just went through an apartment search of our own and settled on a large 2br in ridgewood for $2600, 1 block from the train. we viewed, spoke w brokers abt, or even just saw listed soooo many places between $2k-$2.5k in ridgewood, sunnyside, astoria, woodside, forest hills, lic. and these were all 1 or 2 brs. i’m a bk native and honestly i was able to find way more within our needs in queens.  what you want is very much out there and available, especially in queens.  eta i also have a close friend who moved into a $1600 stabilized 1br in ridgewood last summer, they live alone. check out sunnyside, woodside, and jackson heights! deeper queens neighborhoods like bayside, auburndale have those prices but obviously much further from the city.  i feel for you on the affordable housing units, the income ranges and rent price combination is ridiculous. how does an “affordable” rent price of $3,000 make sense for someone making 80-102k?! i’m moving out of my 1 bedroom, first floor, $1850 apartment in woodside. but the reason i’m moving is because cockroaches. streeteasy. filter by neighborhood and cost. if no brokers fee is important, keep an eye out constantly, ask for a viewing as soon as you see it, go to the first viewing offered, and be prepared to apply right after.   i've missed out on opportunities because someone offered a two year lease, because i couldn't make an earlier viewing and the person before applied first, etc. managed to find something that fits my needs at $2k / separate kitchen / no brokers fee / no basement apartment. my building is nice and there are studios on the first floor with private backyard space that just rented for ~$2300. 65th avenue and austin street so good area near public transportation 2.5k is an amazing budget for queens lmaoo but depending on how close to manhattan you have to be okay with older buildings and no laundry which i'm assuming is the issue? story of my life. sending you hugs. there’s nothing i hate more than housing insecurity and the sheer stress that comes with apartment hunting in nyc . it’s an absolute nightmare. what neighborhoods are you looking in? i think that’s very doable if you look into deep queens like whitestone, bayside, east flushing  update i just looked on street east, checked bayside and middle village, multiple 1br under 2500 where are you looking?  woodhaven is still affordable- close to all transit and highways are you only looking at long island city? walk the ‘hood.  there is sooooo much underground renting that go on.   mom, pop and grandma’s. they don’t advertise. look sane, dress nice, get a manicure and a haircut.    walk the ‘hood. :-)  source: a new yorker, generations here. heeeeyyyyyy everybody thanks to those with helpful tips and kind words. some clarifications:  -this was a rant and i threw out the upper limits of what studios are costing in the areas i'm looking at. 2k/2.5k is not my budget, it's what i've had to set search filters to to find any available units at all.   -my actual budget is, at the very highest, $1,700. next year i could bump that up to $1,800, barring any disasters with my job. and those are ""we have food at home"" numbers. i currently make 67k/year.   -i'm looking in sunnyside, woodhaven, elmhurst, east elmhurst, maspeth, middle village, and jackson heights. i'd also do flushing if it's off the 7. if i look in astoria or lic, i hurt my own feelings. but if by some miracle something popped up in those areas, that would be a dream. i work in manhattan and looooooord i would like a commute under an hour.   -i definitely keep an eye on craigslist and facebook marketplace, but vetting for scammers is like a second/third full-time job. and lately i'm just tired of doing it.   -more a preference than a need: dog-friendly.      ok thanks byyyyeeee i’m just about to move out of sunnyside, but i was/am there with my gf in a semi one bedroom. it did the job especially as we were both grad students in a health prof. i highly recommend the neighborhood, really nice but if you have a car finding parking can be a struggle, and the rent was sub 2k. i have a friend who doesn’t have a super high salary co-sign with his parents and he had no issues getting accepted for a 2450 a month apartment. he’s still fully responsible himself, but it helped him to have a co-signer. consider that as an option if it’s available to you! facebook market place there’s hundreds of studios for 1200-1700 in queens… you’re not looking in the right places. goal posts always move in life, thats what life is, but damn kiddo, you're kickin butt. i dont know you but i am proud of anyone who gets sober, progresses in their career and income. please know youre doing an absolutely amazing job. look into far rockaways,  jackson heights/ flushing. i’m sure you can find a 1 bedroom there below 2k, there’s more to living beside the trendy hipster neighborhoods. you could also check out the bronx. belmont, botancle gardens are safe areas. your just being picky & with that you have to realistic that you prob won’t find a studio under your price point. are you even looking...

88,I made a game to test how well you know the NYC rental market,"it kept saying higher higher higher 😪 hehe so fun some of these are insane wow i’m totally off by a lot 🤣😂 does this have the exact location somewhere that i’m not seeing? it’s hard to guess by the inside alone with location factoring into price so much this is great i feel like a lot of people in this sub underestimate the cost of apartments here and on fb housing groups. so many people comment under apartment posts calling them overpriced or a scam but...it's the market. it's overpriced to *you* but not to new york i did decently.   fun game,  but it just made me depressed afterwards lmaoo humbling experience fun and depressing! omg this is awesome haha.  also brb moving to fort george (where?) very cute! best thing i’ve done in a while god damnit i hate the nyc rental market this is not nyc. it is manhattan. fun! neat idea! i was able to guess the uptown unit but lost after that (kept guessing too low for the downtown unit). have you considered adding other boroughs? i’m from the bronx, so it would be neat to see some of the harder to guess units on here. nice this is fun, gj this is great. really well done. only request would be to move the higher/lower message up on the page. i didn’t see it for a while. should have the amount of bedrooms in the initial prompt yo this is awesome this is so cool! is the source code online? i’d love to check out how you made this :) easy cant believe the uptown one is only $1.7k are there rent controlled units in this as well? i ask because the first one was a 1 bed 1 bath, but for a crazy low rent compared to market rate, so i kept guessing way too high apparently i love this but would be better to know the neighborhood info first! uptown is vague, an apartment that’s 1800 in fort george might be 4500 on the ues 🥴 one of those was 30k. 30k!! this is just depressing qq i only got one right. sheesh dude one in midtown 3bed 3.5 bath was 30k. kept saying higher higher higher update: thanks for all the feedback! i ended up adding br/baths to the first hint along with only 1 photo, and moving the rest of the photos to the second hint. let me know if yall have any other suggestions!  also thinking about maybe removing a life to make it a little more challenging? i think you should cut it into four and split uptown in two. fun game you need to include more detail upfront. a unit with washer dryer or outdoor space can vary wildly i don’t need a game, i fucking know it and this game sucks. 😑 the reason why apartments are so expensive is because people like yall who ain’t from ny coming here and spending stupid amounts of money on roach infested apartments. do yourselves a favor it’s not cool to get robbed on rent in nyc it won’t make you cool being here you will be broke forever so find a new city to gentrify the market isn’t a game. it’s a war.",207,79,positive,0.7532986998558044,286,if you stay here you will be broke forever. if you stay here it’s a war. if you stay here it’s not a game. it’s a war. i’m not a nycer. i’m from nyc. i’m from nyc. i’m from nyc. i’m from nyc. i
89,I’m a divorced woman in 60s,"i don’t think this is unique to you.  i feel like a lot of people feel this and don’t talk about it openly.  i just was talking to someone today about us trying to move into the same building in order to form our own sense of community.  my current building has far too much turn over for a genuine sense of community.  and the rent is out of control for absolute garbage, so there isn’t even any value to have people stay. i'm in my 60s. you might really like the connecticut shoreline -- in fairfield if you can afford it, because you can get to the city in an hour, otherwise new haven county (new london county is another option but it's further from nyc).    i am in new haven county. i lived in nyc my whole life but moved here for a job a couple of decades ago and have been moving back and forth. downtown new haven has a fantastic arts/entertainment scene and some of the best restaurants in the usa, but it's also got sirens and crowds, though to a lesser degree than the city   but -- branford, guilford, madison, and clinton are all beach towns, ten minutes from downtown new haven. the drive to nyc takes 90 minutes to 115 minutes. and you still have metro north but it's 2 hours 15 minutes to grand central.   i used to live in a branford hamlet called short beach footsteps away from the beach, across the street from the salt marshes. so i kayaked at night and ran my dogs in the marshes every day. i absolutely loved it.   my old house sold about a year ago for around 300k and prices haven't gone up much since then. there was only one house between me and the long island sound. i had 1500 square feet. old house (built 1900). definitely not fancy but very bright and airy.   there are rentals in the beach towns around here but not many and they go fast.   there are a lot more rentals in stamford which is close to new york, but somewhat quieter. it's also a great place to live and while it has a city feel and city attractions there are some quieter neighborhoods (some of those stamford high rises that aren't downtown are surrounded by rolling hills).   these aren't the only ct options either. the connecticut and new haven subs on reddit are both very active. check them out.   the thing is, are you sure you want to leave new york city? if i could afford to  i'd move back.  friend of mine just moved back to the upper west side at age 85 (she's very spry, still swims every day).   don't do anything drastic. if you have a great perch in new york city, you could find someone who'd swap their beach place with you for weekends in nyc on a regular basis, so you get your toe in the water, so to speak.   best of luck, whatever you decide. i’m nearly half your age and i can relate to you a lot, for several reasons. if you want a quiet neighborhood with good park access, your best bet is going to be south slope, windsor terrace, and parts of lefferts gardens.  if money is no object, my runner up suggestion would be upper west side right on riverside.  in general, go for the back side of a building. elevator if possible. good luck! i live in riverdale, bronx and it is soooo quiet…(the noise coming from the tenants above and next door to me are a whole other issue 😫) there are a lot of quiet neighborhoods in bk.   carroll gardens, brooklyn heights, park slope, prospect heights, crown heights, sunset park all the way down to bay ridge.  i guess depending on your budget.  if you’ve never been to prospect park, it’s better than cp imo.  better vibe, no tourists.    i myself moved from st. louis 18 years ago. come to park slope if you can swing it. just moved to stamford ct from n fl because my daughter and family live in nyc (and my husband has alz). i missed my family  and needed some family support, mid 60s. it was the best thing i ever did. wish i could afford  nyc but only an hour away. it was hard but several months later so much happier!  ps i dont know a sole here. what about roosevelt island? it’s a lovely neighborhood with lots of park areas, quiet walking trails, water views and a very neighborhood vibe. there are quiet neighborhoods. washington heights north of 181 and west of bway, inwood west of bway (and inwood park is amazing, as is fort tryon park), marble hill, parts of kingsbridge, and riverdale all in the bronx, a lot of forest hills and richmond hills in queens, park slope, plg, flatbush on the side streets.   most of staten island, of course, but if you want to be near a park, then you’re a bus ride away from the ferry. i grew up in whitestone, it’s certainly a quiet neighborhood. it is expensive, but there’s plenty of room to walk, there’s a few parks, people stop and let you walk at stop signs etc. there’s also middle village, maspeth, floral park, bellerose.. i would call these quieter neighborhoods but it’s somewhat subjective you don’t have a circle of friends? you’d likely have similar issues wherever you live. have you thought about living up in inwood? it’s a lot quieter up there than most places in nyc. i feel like windsor terrace would be a good fit for you. it's quiet, next to the best park, super dog friendly and lots of generational diversity. a mix of younger families and older, and folks help each other out. at your age (i'm not far behind you) i'd worry that moving to a quiet town/suburb could be quite isolating, especially after being used to the city for 15 years. agree that into the unknown on facebook is a valuable resource for these types of questions. i'm almost your age but i grew up here so i'm probably used to the noise. the upper east side, especially east of second avenue, is really quiet and more affordable than you would think. you might also look into inwood at the very tip of manhattan. join the group into the unknown on facebook.  you will get a lot of suggestions not sure of your price point but battery park city has all you're looking for. if you like manhattan, try the far ues. east end avenue is paradise. do you want friends? have you looked into aging in place organizations? my relatives belong to one and they attend wine tastings, play readings, photography classes, dive bar dining, etc. fort greene in bk is my fav neighborhood in the city for so many reasons. but for what you need - very quiet and right near ft greene park! you could try inwood.  far up but quieter.  inwood park is the last virgin forest in nyc. how do you love your life and also have zero friends?  i'm as introverted as the next guy but to live my whole life without any friends whatsoever seems pretty goddamn depressing before you choose a neighborhood to rent or buy in nyc, look up the [crime stats](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/borough-and-precinct-crime-stats.page) for that neighborhood. good luck in your search! expecting the city to not be a city [removed] [removed] harlem/hamilton heights. think 140-150. super super quiet, a few parks are right there, easy transit. 145th is quite a hill though as a warning. sunnyside gardens in queens - very short subway ride to manhattan.  very, very quiet. so many dogs! a few dog runs.  i live here (with my dogs) and highly recommend it! queens!!! windsor terrace is super nice and quiet and near the train come to staten island i’ll show you around, clove lake park area very lovely try philly! retired early during covid times and moved here from maine three years ago and have never been happier. philly has pretty much everything nyc does except the ridiculous high prices and philly people are much, much friendlier. the art scene is super supportive and people actually engage with each other. it’s a very dog friendly city, the largest urban park in america, and every kind of housing from historic row homes to glass skyscrapers. one hour 15 minutes from moynihan to 30th street station. i’m from mo living in ny too… but only for 4 years. stl is getting so dangerous and bad lately.   i think park slope is nice!! i had an insanely quiet apartment in astoria--back of the building on 29th street.  weehawken nj by the ferry is also very quiet and has easy city accessibility, although you'd need a car for shopping and errands. hi, i'm a single woman near your age living in jersey city. i came from nyc. it's so much nicer here, quiet yet vibrant, super art community, pet friendly. i think you would love it here. it's a little more affordable than nyc, and the lifestyle is amazing. i can hop on the path any time and be at wtc in under 10 minutes (including train wait time). also no need to have a car. feel free to dm me. have you looked at rockaway. great public transport but much quieter! i live in bensonhurst.  this area and surrounding is pretty quiet.  parks, families, suburbs.  it’s not a bad commute to and from the city. dyker heights bay ridge",199,67,positive,0.6861695647239685,266,"i’m in my 60s. i moved to ct because i missed my family and needed some family support. i’m in my 60s. i moved to ct because i missed my family and needed some family support. i’m in my 60s. i’m in new haven county. i live in the beach towns around here. i would recommend south slope, windsor terrace, and parts"
90,Just ranting about how brokers don’t have souls,"i had a broker who didn't even show up and when i called they said i should just ask the doorman to show me around. why do they get paid in situations where they don't do jack shit? i had a broker tell me to come to a showing at 4 pm and then was nowhere to be found. it took 3 phone calls, text messages, and emails for him to respond to me saying that 4 pm wouldn’t work for him anymore and to show up at 1:50 pm the next day. he then had the audacity to say he’d cut his commission to 12% if we gave him our apartment to list (we own our current place and needed to move to a larger space). thankfully, we didn’t get that apartment and ended up in a much nicer spot.   i agree that it’s maddening and completely unprofessional to not receive a response. i will say, however, some of these brokers are just completely overwhelmed with responses. for the place we ended up renting both me and my husband had to call/text/email the broker several times to even get an appointment to view the apartment and then several more times once we submitted our application to make sure we were being considered. we basically spammed her email and cell. the broker was extremely apologetic and said she is typically much more responsive but was just completely blindsided by how much interest there was. if it’s a place you really want and if it’s in a desirable neighborhood you may have to put in more work (which completely sucks, especially if you’re paying a commission on top of all of it). years back i commuted from ridgewood to cobble hill by bus to see an apartment. the broker was 20 minutes late, head buried in phone the entire time we interacted, and told me to go on up to the top floor by myself, the door was open.  went up, no it fucking wasn’t. and guess who didn’t have a key? and of course just sort of stared at me until i said ok cool bye i guess!?!?  only time i’ve called someone’s office to complain about them. brokers are scumbags. i’m currently looking for apartments and it actually insane how some brokers are downright rude and you have to sit there and wonder how on earth it’s justifiable to write them a check for it.   i tried to rent a very sought out apartment and won a bidding war only to drop out because of the experience of dealing with the landlords broker. straight up made me feel incompetent and broke, only to then tell me i’m the best candidate and offer me the lease. then pressuring me to sign the lease asap and brag about other amazing candidates who want the place. ignored all the red flags and it took that one last comment to send me over the edge. can we complain about broker fees lol. i had three separate brokers show me apartments that had pending applications without disclosing first. one of them actually took a good faith deposit (i got it back thankfully) while having a pending app!!! they are literally so scummy, i searched high and low and found an apt listed by the owner. thank god every broker i’ve gone through has been visibly strung out, late, didnt know anything about the apartment, and rushed us out in 5 minutes or less. theyre parasites i know a couple brokers who are genuinely in it to find people the housing of their dreams, but the other 90% of brokers are soulless scum in it for the money. perhaps we should all pool the money we would have to otherwise pay brokers and just bribe our politicians. paying them more than the real estate lobby might be the only way out of this hellish position we're in. it’s their ridiculous 15% that makes them scumbags. 22 years of living in nyc and i’ve only paid a broker fee once. it was maybe 300 or 500 for each me and my roommate and that was it. same goes for the landlords. these have a special place in hell. support the good agents.   seriously if someone is nice and professional, refer them to a friend. real estate gets better when you promote the good people. tell your landlord if the agent was good or bad.  there are many nice good dedicated people doing their best. i started posting here so people could see we are unique humans.   sometimes nice properties have crappy agents i get it.   i have a blog, i have a youtube, i spend hours talking to people on the phone.  but it’s not just me. you have a bad nurse or teacher, don’t say all nurses and teachers suck.   we have souls. all of the other stuff aside, my lease outlined two sets of keys and the broker only gave us one and she also huffed and puffed and rolled her eyes when i asked to meet up for get the others and got snippy with me. she had the keys in her possession and her office was down the block from the apartment. literally five minutes of work to pass them off. brokers truly do nothing except suck blood and cash checks. it's the biggest scam in the city, these apt broker fees should be illegal it's a joke if you don’t want to rent to anyone working class then brokers are a great barrier to having to lease to poors. i’m a broker with almost all no fee listings. i do agree that the 15% is egregious. but to clarify for everyone saying why doesn’t the landlord show it themselves, they’ve tried that, there was even an app that was pairing tenants with the landlords to view but it never takes off because landlords don’t want to show. they have no interest in interfacing with clients (unless they live in the building)  a lot of brokers now are giving clients the door codes and telling people to go look at places themselves. i would highly advise against an agent  doing this as there are serious squatting/tenants rights laws in place in nyc and i feel like the agents who do this should lose their license. [deleted] lived in nyc for over 15 years and have never needed or used a broker. why do you do it? you should rent directly from a management company, like this one.  https://c2rmanagement.com/elementor-5063/",200,52,negative,0.7617580890655518,252,"i’m a landlord and i know i have a lot of bad agents. i just want to show people that there are good agents out there. i get it. i have a blog, i have a website, i have a blog. i get it. i get it. i get it. i get it. i get it. i get it. i get it."
91,Lied to in the listing,"always ask to actually see the laundry amenities. i once toured a building which claimed to have laundry. yes, there was one washer and one dryer that were situated in the back of a nearly flooded basement (i had to step over puddles and rodent feces). i only actually knew the conditions because i requested to see it. moral of the story, cya. brokers will lie and over exaggerate. it sucks but it’s up to you to do the work. view everything, take notes, get it all in writing, and read every word of the lease before you sign it. good luck. is it listed in the lease? actually i am not so sure you are out of luck. brokerages have insurance for errors and omissions and this sounds like it fits the bill. i would talk to the person in charge of your agents brokerage. the actual broker. i don't see any reason you could not be made whole in some way. this is like the broker with the listing that said “apartment located directly next door to subway!” i go and see the place, and technically they didn’t lie… only it was a subway sandwich shop ask 311 did you pay a broker's fee? if it’s not in the lease i guess there’s nothing you can do. you can however go to the brokers place of business and clarify this with the people he/she work for. will it help? probably not my work around was to go to home depot and buy a washing machine and have it hooked up in the kitchen.  whenever there was an apartment inspection i just rolled into a hiding space.  best money ever spent in a walk up. similar thing happened when we looked for an apt in brooklyn. found a suitable place. toured and liked it. but when asked to see “business center” and laundry room they tried getting us to sign first. which was weird. but we needed an apt bad and had flown out to nyc twice now. got to the agents office and asked again. again the to tried to not talk about it. so we got up to leave. they literally tried blocking the door!! showed us some pics, but weren’t of the sane building 🤦‍♂️. told person if she doesn’t move i’m calling the police first to tell them i’m being held against my will and then i’m going to forcefully remove you. she moved. but the next 2 fucking weeks we got called 2-3 times daily, each of us. begging to come back.   imo these agencies are no better than scammers. thats your own fault for not seeing it first. do they mention laundry on the lease? if not then is he said she said and you are sol i’m sorry this happened to you 😔😔 if it’s listed that there’s laundry in the lease and there’s no laundry you can file a landlord-tenant complaint however if it’s not listed there’s no real recourse.  you can speak to your ll about it maybe they can take a couple bucks off but it’s unlikely, you could also speak to the agents company about it. most brokers and agents lie on listings to get the lease signed. my broker lied to me about the apartment having central air. amongst other things like the home owner not living on site. i went to her boss who tried to brush me off until i wrote a legal demand letter and eventually i got my broker feedback damn that's so shady lmao. what an ass no this happened to me and i was able to get them to install an all in one washer / dryer combo in my unit. i imagine you have a screen shot of the listing?  there’s nothing to stop you from taking broker to small claims court and asking for your brokers fee back. oh so likely building had a laundry unit but it was among the hundreds of properties in city that never filed proper permits or brought basement up to code so it would have been able to pass inspection. - proper ventilation in laundry area is big one they all try to cut corner on. most those units are all gas powered so they need full exhaust systems in these laundry rooms to pass inspections. i got a small washing machine from amazon, and a round clothing rack to dry clothes on. the machine got the clothes nearly dry so just hanging them did the rest. the building i currently live in have 2 tiny washers and 2 huge dryers on each floor at $3+ to wash per machine and $2+ to dry. i hooke fit up in my second bathroom and move it into the corner when not in use. my landlord saw it the other day and said nothing 🤷🏾‍♀️ always operate with the assumption the broker you are dealing with is the scummiest of scum. no matter what.  it’s a parasitic job that encourages scum behavior. you should have asked to see everything the bldg offers before you signed. i'm no attorney but sounds like they committed fraud. should be able to get out of it. hey a lot of misinformation.  1.) you dont know if you were lied to  in the listing it says laundry. maybe the broker got the listings and it said laundry for them too and like you assumed it was just locked.  2.) people here say only in the lease enforceable  yes and no. the lease can say things and it doesnt mean it can or cant be enforced because the law trumps it.   3.) listing says it broker says it  save print a copy of that. speaker to broker again and mention that they told you there is laundry but none. ask what they can do?   if you dont like what you hear speak to the owner of the brokerage.  if again it doesnt work out, then speak to the management and let them know and show proof.  you do it in this order. because if you go the other way then you have less options. because you will get the previous person 'yelled' at and they will be less likely to help you since you dont have power.   4.) you go press harder.  so the law is in your favor.who cares what is written or stated. a lot of people are just talking out of thier you know what because there is what is written and what actually happens. like you can have a contract that says one thing but the law or court rulings always go another way.   you now can let the brokerage know that something will be done legally if they dont find a way to make it up to you. remember you get more with honey than vinegar. only use vinegar as a last resort to get what you want.  i can go over exactly what to do in your dms if it gets to that level. try honey first.  experience:  3+ years real estate agent, 4+ years management company, 2+ years of going to housing court, 10+ years all in nyc and all of this was in nyc ugh idk but i feel you. there actually was laundry in my building when i moved in and one day it was just gone lmao they removed the machines w no warning and they never came back. luckily there’s a new rly nice & fast laundromat right down the street but ugh they probably lied about the square footage too. measure it. brokers and agents work without weekly and or monthly income. it’s a shame that the bad seeds spoiled the whole fruit. there is no larger entity standing up for the profession.",199,71,negative,0.4584773480892181,270,i have 2 closet. i have a washer and dryer combo that i bought from amazon and closet. i have a washer and dryer combo that i bought from amazon for $120. closet. i have a washer and dryer combo that i bought from amazon for $120. i have a washer and dryer combo that i bought closet. brokers and agents....
92,I fell for a lease takeover scam. Learn from my mistakes.,"thanks for sharing, sorry that happened to you. wow this is awful   how did you send them the money and if they blocked you; they used a real number ? have you contacted the police ? during my last apartment search i called about a listing and i talked to someone on the phone for quite a bit over 2 days about my living habits and my employment etc, but when they asked for money without seeing the place first i said i wasn’t comfortable with it and passed. it sucked because the apartment looked really good. not too good to be true, but just good enough to feel a little lucky to be in the right place right time. reading your experience makes me think that this was actually what was going on. yikes, did you do you try to find out if that ""tenant"" was a real person by asking for their verified linkedin profile or social media? did you report it to https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us there are a lot of online scam flying around lately, i myself a victim. don’t beat yourself, these people are here to target and steal money.. this bad karma/vibe will be returned to the scammers, dont you worry thanks for sharing this to warn others.. go to the police. please.  i'm sorry this happened to you. it will take time but you can get your money back. was this at 395 leonard? if so, there's a group of people who have been scammed on here by the same person who have managed to get their money back from the scammer sorry that happened op, and thanks for the tip.   been scammed before and a simple way to move forward and not feel dumb is to look at it like this:   you're good at whatever your job, so good that someone who tries to do it could maybe be good to the eyes of a common man, but garbage in the eyes of you, an expert.  same thing with scamming, it's their chosen (very shitty) trade. you're a master of whatever you do and not of being a garbage person, so garbage will from time to time get the upper hand in garbage people activities.   with love from a former scammee man that sucks. i was in a similar spot a little while ago. wishing you the best. wish there was a way to get someone not affiliated with the apt to go look at for you - maybe they could fish out the scam i’m so sorry this happened to you. fwiw i nearly fell for a bank scam recently, and i was shocked at how easily they hooked me. luckily i listened to the alarm bells in my head but if i hadn’t i would have been out thousands. when your emotions are involved you sometimes lose track of logic. it happens to lots of folks, even people who think it could never. don’t let anyone make you feel bad - you already have enough to feel shitty about. [deleted] well, you can do the same thing, round and round it goes from what i understand if there is *any* hope of recovery, the sooner you get the authorities involved, the better. not saying it will help, but if it was me i’d still report every one of these fuckers.

94,What has been your (recent) experience with buying property in NYC?,"summer 2022, 1 bed condo in ues/east harlem - $700k for 600sqft 😅  never thought about buying but saw so many friends do it during the pandemic. and then decided to liquidate investments enough for a 10% down… i’m house poor for sure. esp bc i didn’t get the nice 2-3% pandemic rates and bought when the rates skyrocketed  came from capital b broke - so not much help from anyone else 🤷‍♀️ the only person i know who bought their apartment post-pandemic comes from capital m money. they could not have bought it without their father pitching in. define post pandemic.... bought aug 2021 in brooklyn 1 bedroom condo. what specific questions do you have? we bought our apartment in dec 2023. we’re poor now. closed on a coop in queens in the past month for just under $300k. pretty simple process. how is the bidding war situation like nowadays i had clients of mine who found me on here, buy on the upper east side when rates were still in the 3's, that closed in spring of 2022. we were able to get an absolute steal, the apartment appraised like 50k over our accepted offer. the only snag was, the board was a mess and we couldn't get them to meet so it almost blew up, but they finally convened with a few weeks to spare, they loved my clients, and they are very happy there to this day. we still hang out and text all the time! they are self made people with no family help.  i've had several instances of this over the last few years, a single mom repeat client of mine bought with me recently and she is self made, too.  then to contrast that, i had someone find me on here last year, a younger guy and his gf, and his dad paid for the entire 40% dp (it was a condo but they wanted to put more down).  it varies, but couples making over 100k each can still get there if they are frugal and save. rates are going to continue going down i was ready to put 20% down on a $200,000 studio in an hdfc coop in uptown manhattan (half the down payment was mine, half, yes, was from my mom.) i'm a waitress in fine dining, i've saved for the last ten years.     i got all the way to the final part of the process and my mortgage agent wasn't able to secure a commitment letter. she had needed to see the building's finances improve or stay stable (they hadn't been great, but there was hope for improvement) and instead they'd worsened. in the months after i'd put in an offer on the apartment, two people in the building died, and dead people don't pay their bills, putting two units into arrears.  now i'm waiting to see a unit come on the market that i like. i'm not going to buy something that doesn't tick all my boxes of what i need, but i've been watching the market on hdfc's and i'm confident that eventually something will open up that i can afford. my mortgage agent told me i'm the perfect candidate for an hdfc in terms of income and credit score etc. i’m in jackson heights (which is actually 20 -25 mins to midtown using the e/f/7) and it’s pretty reasonably priced (coops vs condos). queens is often overlooked but should the soccer stadium come to fruition (on top of citi field, lga, us open), it’s reasonable to continue seeing momentum for the upside. relatives sold and bought a bigger house in staten island recently, first gen family with 2 white collar late millennials and parents pool money together. been looking at studios on the uws. prices are affordable but monthly maintenance fees are crazy. it’ll be exciting to find one under $1000 a month. i noticed no one even considered a multi fam. let me suggest an alternative. for the price of a condo you can find a 2 family or 3 family house (maybe a little more) in a more up and coming neighborhood (ridgewood or woodside or sunnyside, maybe sunset park or bay ridge). you’ll thank me in 10 years. i bought a 4 family in ridgewood in 2020 for 1.35. my mortgage is 3800. one apt nearly pays for my mortgage…. i live in one. rent 3 units out. bought a 1br condo in ues in late 2021. my partner and i had been saving up since 2019. a large part of it was luck - we were able lock in a 3% mortgage and the rsus we sold for the down payment had peaked in price right before crashing in 2022. we wouldn’t be able to afford our place if we were buying today i bought in riverdale in january 2020. prices here remain extremely reasonable. it’s such an underrated and undervalued neighborhood. i wish more people would consider it. bought in summer of 2021. 2-bedroom 680-ish square feet in an hdfc co-op in north brooklyn. listed at $410k, bought at $380k with 20% down and $9.8k in closing costs.  no bidding war because it had been on the market a little over a year due to the nature of how hdfc buildings work. needed a good sales agent to get the process thru (that took almost 6 months from the first viewing) and a good lender (took almost 30 inquiries, a mixture of hdfc, co-op, and my status as a freelancer). all-in-all glad i purchased when i did because with interest rates where they are at today i’d never be able to afford this place today. golden lining of the pandemic was wiping all my income away for two years allowing me to qualify for the hdfc program. what about it?  you can look up all recent sales in streeteasy with their comparables feature. that’ll tell you what a reasonable price per square foot and such is.  bidding war or not depends on asking price more than anything else. ~~fha~~ 203k loan. great lender. great realtor. solving for my mortgage payment by saving the difference between my rent and house payment. buying a two family so the rental would help cover costs. bought a 3 bedroom in park slope (ish) and couldn't have done it without literally multiple ipo windfalls.  i feel extremely lucky because i am. blue collar / middle class family so no help. if anything we send them money.   the amount of money it takes to buy here is just unreal even at the ""entry level"". (which a 3 bed is not.) i bought a 700k home in staten island in 2023. no i didn’t have “ daddy’s money “ i listened to a shit ton of finance podcasts and lived below my means for 7 years and it worked out for me! con i live in staten island lol bought a $3 million three bed condo in manhattan recently. rates suck, no getting around that. we were able to get a lot of the closing costs paid for by the seller, so our effective closing costs were like 3%. marginal movement on price but not that much. monthly payment sucks but it’s a much bigger and nicer place than what we were in, and we are hoping for rates lowering in a couple of years but are not counting on it [deleted] bought a 2/1 in harlem with sizable outdoor space <1m. don’t wanna give too many details for safety. 20% down, but it being a coop softened the closing costs substantially—i don’t think i paid any closing costs after seller concessions from due diligence finds and a credit from my bank. i was able to use a program that gave me a 3.75 rate based on zip code and i used first republic so the underwriting process was much easier. just closed early jan on a tiny <300 sqft sro studio in an older building on the uws. a bit higher than i wouldve preferred street wise. also paid a premium for water views. 100k less off listing price but still feel like i overpaid. (high 300s, when other studios in the same building closed at low 300s.)  self savings from the last decade but also now i’m broke. parents chipped in to show post closing reserves so the board would approve. but in my mind, that’s not my money. so yes, i’m broke.  i don’t make a lot, under 100, above 50. spent within my means. it’s a very small space, but for now it’s just me and hopefully a dog soon. realtor said “does this space work for you?” and i felt like it did.  downside of older building: everything’s kinda falling apart or needs to be replaced. neighbors seemed to have done gut reno. don’t have any more funds to do that so.  process took a lot longer than it should’ve. my offer stayed the same since late summer and i went up 2,500 finally. contract in october and closed early jan. not a great time to buy ha (holiday season). a lot of people buying studios in this thread, which is great. my partner and i will likely need a 2 bedroom (master plus an office), which is part of why we're struggling to find something affordable. everything is ridiculously expensive and/or in a rough neighborhood. i've been trying to convince her to consider places in philly, hudson, new england etc, but she's dead set on the city. it's been a struggle. i have a friend that bought a co-op in bayside for about 200k. it was 1 of 3 properties available within her budget. and i believe she might have gotten rejected by 1 or two of them before actually getting that one. fha loan anybody? [deleted] bought a 700k two bedroom co-op around 1000sf in crown heights in early 22. no help, 20% down, process was a pain but think i got a decent deal. offered slightly over ask (695) because i had lost out on a couple previous offers. i just sold a co op in mid town and i can tell you that was hell. i can't imagine buying would be any less frustrating i bought in a comfortable neighborhood for me for 95 recently. currently live in park slope area renting a 1br for like 4k. we’re going to have our first child in october and will need a 2br. we also both work from home and are trying to figure out what to do.   we love brooklyn and don’t want to move back to nj. not sure if we should continue to rent or buy at this point.  where would someone start? hey op!  i bought in rockland because i can't afford shit in nyc.   i'm from queens and the housing prices are crazy and my landlord was selling his building, the new rent for our 2 bd, 2 bath was beyond ridiculous. we paid 1800, living in jamaica, with the new ""management"" it was looking close 3300.   we saved a little bit of money (been there for 5 years + we paid full rent during covid so our landlord never bothered us) so we were like okay we're gonna try to buy a apartment/condo because it's no where enough near for a house.   biddings wars everywhere, nyc + westchester - ridiculous nice places fly off the market so fast, sometimes a seller will accept the first offer and run. even nj is overpriced because a lot of nyers went to buy there. so we had no choice the only place with ""reasonable"" prices that we could afford was rockland; i know i'm not happy because commuting to manhattan for work is going to be annoying but didn't have a choice. at least there's no city traffic, no noise and there's a lot more outdoor activities!  yeah, i feel like we even overpaid in rockland because it's ""close"". va loan and the property is in a rough neighborhood with 3/10 schools and trashy filled burned up houses in the yard.   half a mil i bought a housing lottery apartment from someone who didn’t want it anymore in early 2022.  i’d been saving for 5 years and just got lucky (right place, right time). most buyers i work with have some sort of financial assistance to buy here. it’s something i mention on on buyer consultations given some people have the down payment but don’t usually have the post closing savings lined up to buy. it’s not a point of shame taking money from family and that’s why i bring it up. most of the time, it’s money well spent vs renting and can eventually be paid back i grew up by fordham road. not poor but the family never pitched in for anything. worked in tech sales and in \~5 years out of college made 70k, 90k,120k,200k, and 300k and saved about half my income. lived pretty well but just budgeted every expense and only at the 200k year did i have a 1 bedroom which was $2500/month. total monthly expenses were never over 4k.     the budgeting was super helpful but would have been impossible without the income. could have saved more and expedited this with a romantic partner. would be very hard to make this income in your 20s unless you are in tech sales, finance, law, engineer... doctor would be hard as you would accrue a lot of debt before having an income.  buying experience was really long process \~5 months from looking at apartment to closing in early 2022. nice to live in a home and great for taxes and sense of security. financially, i'm not sure it makes a ton of sense since i could get better returns in the market. but it was my dream growing up in the bronx to buy in the city and i'm glad i did it. bought in 2021 after living very frugally for 6 years with hella roommates in brooklyn. 2br condo (800 sq ft) + giant outdoor space (750 sq ft) + parking. i paid for the downpayment, my partner covered most of the closing costs. it would have taken me another year of saving to do closing costs on my own, most likely. wiped out all of my savings pretty much after the purchase... so, there's that. i recently purchased a 2 bedroom co-op apartment in bay ridge (september 2022). we spent our life savings on the down payment (we are in our early 30's) and both of our families gave us some extra cash to cover the closing costs. we also got a decent mortgage rate of 4.1% from first republic (rip). i can't say it was easy to do, but we were diligent about saving our money for over 10 years and were going to have to spend about half of it in order to move into a rental that year, so we decided to look for a place to buy. i know not everyone is lucky enough to have parents that can help them out financially, but that is part of the reason why i was able to buy the place. real estate is a cut throat business, especially in nyc, best of luck to you and it helps if you have a spouse/partner to help out with the purchase! i'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  and no, i'm sorry, you cannot borrow some money. closed july 2021........ i am super happy with the purchase. it was probably the smartest decision i ever made. i dont know what got into me to go against the grain and start looking at apartments in deep covid but for once my late night bored brain did something right.  i brought a studio in chelsea. gut renovation. got a for a great price but it took 8 months to complete the renovation because supply chains were super backed up during covid. i am renting it to a tenant right now but since i got it for such a steal i make a good chunk of passive income. i am not rich, i am just a normal corporate gal with a decent job but i am disciplined spender. i wont lie my father is a co-owner and gave me a huge monetary gift and i could have never done it without him. but dont get it twisted when we sell the property he does expect that money back for his retirement. but i recognize how this would have never happened without him and my mother. my parents arent rich either just worked super hard and saved their pennies for retirement. i will add i have always been very good with money and live within my means. i do indulge once a year or something on something big but overall i keep my expenses fairly regularly. very obtuse question. are you asking about primary residence or investment prop ? nyc is not a real place after reading what it cost to get a condo or co-op. everyone is getting shafted. smh. god this is a sickening topic. too expensive vacant murder lots in my astoria neighborhood are going for 700k+, sadly home ownership is not currently in the cards we bought in may 2021 so not super recent but post pandemic. caught the low interest rates before they went back up so no regrets i only know some people who are foreign investors manage to rent a rent stabilize apartment  that the landlord up rented   got the difference back and i'm happy where i am.   3 bedroom near soho? $1900 month rent. it only goes up 2% a year or 4% every 2 years  i paid like $3500 for a year and half when i first moved in. until i found out it was rent stabilize bought a 1 bedroom condo near jackson heights for slightly under 500k. i got lucky with my rate because of first republic eagle program so it was under 4% in early 2023. had to put 20% down but i’ve been saving for years closed in september on an 850 sqft 1 bedroom (junior 4) in brooklyn for $375k.   i was very rational/non-emotional about the search - looked at every apartment in close walking distance to prospect park, with elevators, that either was or could be converted to a legal 2 bedroom, and was within my price range. there were very few options, but as long as something met those criteria i knew i could be happy living there long term. i will have to renovate at some point (my apartment has not been renovated since the building was built in the 60s) but that was a pro for me since i like design and i imagine i’ll enjoy a big project. plus, based on renovated comps in the building, we can do a fair amount of work and still come out ahead financially. real estate agents are real pieces of shit. racism from agents is real in higher end apartments. me and my husband are interracial and the amount of times we were told that we can’t see apartments unless we sign a anti-discrimination release form or were “warned” about the price is ridiculous.",194,278,neutral,0.4999126493930816,472,a condo is a lot more expensive than a 2 family house. buy a 2 family or 3 family house (maybe a little more) in a more up and coming neighborhood. i bought a 4 family in ridgewood in 2020 for 1.35m. i’m house poor now. i bought a brooklyn condo in april 2021. i’m house poor now. i bought a
95,"What's your response when someone tells you ""I could never live in New York. I don't know how people can live here"" ?","""k"" it's not for everyone you don’t have to. has been my response lately that's fair, i could never live where my only option for entertainment was regal cinema or kohl's restocking day on tuesday. to each their own. “ok … well you dont have to live there”  someone in my family always says this to me and im just like no matter how many times or different ways you say it, im still going to make that move. ""i dont even think about living (insert where they live)"" idk what makes people think they can comment on where i live so openly when i didn't ask them. most of our family lives in rural va-  ""oh i could never live in nyc""  ""ok well it's boring af out here, idk how you do it either"" that’s okay, not many people can “no one has asked you to” or “the city isn’t missing you” the people who say this are usually people who never could. like they could never deal with being a small fish in a big pond or being around diverse groups, etc. so i simply say ""i know"" with the perfect amount of shade in my tone. good, don't [deleted] ![gif](giphy|g4znymqvmh6us) ""i could never live where you live"" “and that’s why you don’t live here” “you wouldn’t make it here” first of all, rude thing to say if you live in nyc. second, i would love to know where they live that it’s so much better. the small town with a few breweries as their big selling point? nyc is one of the most culturally-rich cities in the world. you can find any cuisine in many forms, from street vendor to michelin star restaurant. fantastic music venues, museums, shops, bars, parks, etc. you could pick one part of brooklyn and do everything that is offered in an entire city in america.  i’m exaggerating a bit, but it’s mostly true. nyc has plenty of problems like any major city. it’s expensive, sometimes dirty, untreated mental illness, but, the community and culture is worth it in my opinion. 9 million people do. so my response is typically,  ""have you ever been there before?""  and i wait to hear what they have to say.   i've driven around the entire united states, and the one thing i learned is this:   **if you are from nyc, you don't understand how the rest of the country functions. and if you are not from nyc, you have no idea how nyc functions.**   something i can only say after driving around the country in a van, doing touring theatre, hanging out with audience members, and trying to live out of motels. depends on who is saying it and if they are being condescending while expressing their views. they are many parts of living here that are awful, exclusionary, and unsafe that may drive me out of the city in the future despite having built a full life here me: ""i agree.""  i just... there are some things to \*like\* about nyc, but there are a lot of things to \*loathe\* about nyc  that's just me. i know a lot of people can live a pretty steady, consistent life in here with very little trouble. i admire and honestly am jealous bye.  the door is to the left.  see you never. i hope you're happy where you land. “yeah, you couldn’t” me too i miss ny a lot! moved to dallas a few months ago and i want to go back haha i can’t find the same parks here, can’t find the same quality food at restaurants, everything is better in ny.  it’s definitely more stinky in some places in ny but that’s city life, if people don’t like city life they wouldn’t like many walking cities honestly. it’s funny how it js socially acceptable to say “i could never live in (big city)” but if you say “i could never live in (suburban town)” you’re being rude. i just nod and agree with them.   a. i want to keep rent down b. i've made my own life out for myself here are the last 5 years and if i wanted people from my rural hometown in my regular life still i would've moved back home. i grew up in iowa so i completely understand as far as cleanliness, environment, physical space, quiet etc. but personally i was bored outta my damn mind there and they really can't comprehend the lifestyle you live out here. ya you’re right, you couldn’t i usually say i could never live where they live. okay would you like to list anything else you don’t do? should i start listing the things i don’t do? sorry i’m not so good with weird conversations. why would i care? i can never live in any random suburb but they sure do ""i don't know how you can live here."" anyone that has said this to me hasn’t ever even visited new york good, rent is expensive enough. can you imagine if everyone wanted to live here? “yeah i don’t think you could either” i get it, you don't have the mental fortitude :) new york is devastated by you not being there it takes a certain kind of person to live here. sometimes i wonder whether i am cut out for it. but it is the city that puts all others to shame. i can walk out my door and never hop in a car or even a train and do all of my grocery shopping, go to the gym, sit and read by the waterfront or in a nearby park, decide on dinner at 20 restaurants 300 feet away, and watch the lights flicker on just as the sun sets. i can hear 5 different languages just walking to get breakfast. i have my choice of 10 different coffee shops to do wfh. i can thrift free art and furniture right off the street. maybe there’s a city or two in europe that could, perhaps, match some of the vibes i get here. but if i were a betting man, my money would always be on the sui generis of cities. “i know, i can tell” and look at them smugly. it’s interesting that this is such a common comment - i would never think to turn to someone who lives in kansas and declare that i could never live how they live. it would be so condescending for me to say that as a new yorker, but somehow the reverse is not…? maybe because it’s “punching up” aka the city is so obviously desirable there’s a reason so many of the world’s most popular shows and movies take place here and it’s packed to the gills with people trying to make it here. for this reason i usually shrug it off as little sister behavior. ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) yeah it’s not for the weak the city weeds out the bitches. “i could never live in *insert town or suburb where they live*. i don’t know how people can live there.” “not surprised” okay would you like to list anything else you don’t do? should i start listing the things i don’t do? sorry i’m not so good with weird conversations. my cousin who lives in a trailer in bumfuck, backwoods usa said he could never live here and i just laughed and replied “oh i agree, this city isn’t for the weak.” some people aren’t built to handle how tough it is either “yeah, i don’t think you could either” or “i couldn’t live where you live either” 😂 “8.3 million people live here so its actually not that hard?” don’t. a friend and his wife were flabbergasted when i told them that after a weekend of complaining how much they would never live in nyc while crashing at my place. not with that attitude! yeah you probably couldn’t. ""who says we want you here?"" this is a classic republican/trump attitude, so i view it as very political. ""i'm sorry your mental weakness is drowning out your statement, please rephrase "" 🤷🏻‍♂️ you’re right, you couldn’t. “is that not a rude thing to say where you’re from?” good thing nobody’s inviting you. only the strongest survives new york. i'd say, you don't know what you're talking about. fuck you!  or ""to each, his own"" i say “good” we don’t want you here. you weren’t invited then don’t there’s only one answer. “fuggisyoutalmbout?” you either love it or hate it! it’s great that you don’t then :) i tell them nyc has 8 million people so maybe you should stfu and learn something ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) then dont shut up  go sit over there  please go away “yeah you definitely couldn’t!” my mom always says this. great, you’ve chosen where you want to live and i’ve chosen where i ant to live. i don’t spend all my time telling you how much i hate where you live why do you do it to me lol i say. fuck you. you want to but you can’t it’s usually some fools stuck in an echo chamber of disinformation showing random photos of fire, broken windows, and wrecked police cars from 2020. but yeah, no place like ny. i travel quite a bit, have had to move all over for work, and i always miss ny in the end. don’t let the door hit you in the ass! adios!!! you have to be tough to live in new york a friend of mine lived in new york city had a dog named taxi. “yeah, it’s not for everybody.” tell them they probably wouldn’t be happy here and they should stay where they are. i moved to brooklyn in 2006-straight from college and been here since. could not imagine living anywhere else!!! go fuck yourself! we aren't exactly ""living"" ![gif](giphy|1msy0o1ma3bslybzua|downsized) ![gif](giphy|ldbuyzawu8l4i|downsized)  ""then, don't"" the people who say this would so obviously get eaten alive that i’m not bothered anymore. they can keep thinking that when you live in nyc there’s someone lurking around every corner to stab you and no one speaks english or whatever fb told them. at least i make more than $7/hour and i have the option to fuck someone who isn’t my second cousin. that's fine. say don’t. you have no idea what you’re missing. i lived here my whole life. and love it ""you can't handle it, it's okay."" i agree. [deleted] ""i'm here, in one piece and as financially ranked as the rest of us."" same probably you get used to it.  (i'm a transplant) 👍🏽 “ya know, that reminds me of an old yogi berra saying” ""me neither, can i leave?"" good i know ok then. it's not for everyone and honestly a lot of people complain about creature comforts. i always thought of it as look at the city as your extended living room and you've got every opportunity open to you.  it's not some peoples cup of tea and that's perfectly ok.   i mean, i could never live in new jersey. 🙃 https://preview.redd.it/ay8qe0graiid1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922157c92e472d2f8b90ce9ad6e3c64a1d5380aa  i be like cool i'll enjoy this view regardless. good the rents too damn high already 🤷🏻‍♀️ “i hate driving.” ""lol same. i like the quality of life though. could never live where you do"" nyc has the highest high and lowest lows. i love what makes it great way more than disdain what makes it challenging. “yeah i completely get you, a lot of people i know can’t afford it too” cool. i can’t live in gaithersburg either.  (actual convo with a friend of mine from maryland) i don't know how i live here either. slow blink and stare. my response is basically what others have commented, ""ok"". but i sometimes think i should have answered, ""why does someone living in new york make you feel the need to defend not living in new york?"" great, don't. it’s not for the weak “facts. idk how i live here” “that’s because your a lil bitch” we're full anyways 🤣 well...i don't know how anyone can live here. note: where ever they live. go kick rocks! but also ok good! we don’t want no more transplants lol i mean i’ve lived here for 10 years and own a house in brooklyn and i still kind of feel like i can’t live here the first thing to remember when someone says this is it has nothing to do with you. they are just stating their preference (even if not worded well). so just don't take it personally.  everyone has preferences. usually i say something like ""i hear you"" which validates / witnesses their point of view without giving up mine. aaaaaannnnnnndddddd? i’ve always believed myself a better human for having lived there. ight ok boomer it is helpful to know why they say that. if it’s money, it’s rhetorical. but sometimes it’s bc it seems overwhelming, too big, too anonymous—to which i say, but each neighborhood is a small enclave. you get to know your local small grocer on the corner, your mail person, etc. and then when you walk further out, there’s the vital energy. you start to know which streets to walk, for when you want low-key energy and a direct passage. then another day, you want the variety and the hustle and bustle. i always feel seen in ny, and i equally *see* so many people. a main reason why i love it. give me your wallet! yeah rats are an acquired taste “i could visit the m&m store but i couldn’t live in the m&m store” cool lol but also same because it’s so unreal here lol when i'm feeling spicy: ""yeah, you gotta be tough and smart. not everyone can handle it. nothing wrong with that.""   the last part being said in a tone of voice that insinuates there is, in fact, something wrong with that. *shrugs* “so don’t” get the f out in god speed there is a great new song by morgan st jean - “me this time.”  choosing nyc over a relationship.  i would play it for them mofo leave lol new york is always two decades ahead...imo “nyc is more than just time square and midtown.” ""i understand"" ""i agree"" the patrice o'neal head tilt/shoulder shrug but with the absolute minimum effort possible. of course you couldn't, dear (smiles sympathetically) i send them this video  https://youtu.be/tnpoplflt1w?si=gkripvvihmx4a0hr stay where you’re comfortable. i’m going to explore and discover myself. tell them to enjoy olive garden and everything closing at 8pm, we dont miss you it’s not for everyone i would never live in the suburbs of [atlanta / dallas / charlotte] k cool okay “same” there are more than a million people who disagree more for me ppl are always going to have something to say that could rub you the wrong way. it’s annoying but i’ve learned to just not engage. shrug your shoulders, nod, and move on to the next topic. “so anyway…” ppl aren’t going to change their opinions and you’re better off letting it go than letting it aggravate you.  don’t waste your time or energy! just my 2 cents! ""that's fair."" because they probably have a point of two that is legitimate and probably not being confrontational perse. everyone has their preferences. why they decided to blurt that out loud depends on the situation i guess. why make care payments or car insurance payments or gasoline payments when everything is a block away folks in my hometown often say that but i think they mean it as a compliment, rather than an insult.   as i interpret it, they found the hustle and bustle of new york intimidating when they visited, so they are “in awe” (heavy air quotes there - i’m not so narcissistic i think they’re actually awed by me) of my ability to handle the grit, the trains, the noise, the directness, etc.   i tend to respond, “oh i love it, it’s been a great fit for me.” keeps my pride intact without being dismissive. good. “yeop, only some people can take it.” being this poor must suck a lot of people won't admit what they don't know.  good for them for admitting it. good thing it’s me and not you “good thing you don’t” “i don’t know how i could live here myself, still trying to figure that out” laughter i get it. this place kinda sucks. i mean i can totally see why someone wouldn’t want to live here. it’s not for everyone and as someone who’s lived here most of my life it does get frustrating sometimes. i moved from a quiet neighborhood in the midwest to new york and my response is “eh, ya get used to it after a bit” “yeah i get it. that’s how i feel about the suburbs” i tell them “that’s great, bc i could never live where you live either.” and just look at their face, waiting for the irony to hit. “well millions of people do so it must work somehow!” same! want to grab a coffee at park and 125th? i tell them i can't wait to get out too. then don’t - we have enough people already😀 “probably for the best. you’re not strong enough to handle it anyway” ""that was always allowed"" my husband agrees with them and says “yeah, you wouldn’t make it here.” “yeah, i totally hear you”  lifelong manhattanite going on 53, i get why people say that. it’s such a specific lifestyle. “yea, it’s not for everyone” that’s why the city is so empty! “not everyone can live here” lmao “the struggle is real.” this tickled me. just moved back to manhattan with my husband and four year old after a decade in the burbs. i don't know why everyone is so offended by this question. there's lots of places i wouldn't live either and would say the exact same thing about. that’s ok, it’s just not for you, don’t blame yourself. yeah, it’s not for everyone we don’t want you. nothing. i don’t care. “yeah, ny would probably eat you alive. it’s not for everyone.” “i don’t know how i live here either.” ""i dont blame you, it sucks"" the irony of wanting to live in nyc when i was broke vs being able to afford it now and not wanting to 😂 it’s funny how people say stuff like that not even knowing how nyc is or have never been there…. i agree i tell them - please go - makes more room for the people who truly want to be here. i tell them there is a waiting list for almost all apts. in ny and if there isn't then there is something wrong with the apt.   i tell people that the trick in life is to find a place where you like to live  - and then live there. “good. new york is pretty full.” “it aint for everybody” + 🤷🏽‍♀️ then it’s a good thing you don’t! my response is i don’t blame you that’s a feature, not a bug there's a reason it's in every type of media to each their own. it’s def not for everyone. some people like space and peace and quiet. others want to live in the middle of all the action.  it’s a weird trend where everyone has to attack or defend where they live. if you like it there who gives af lol my wife and i moved back in february after 14 very pleasant years in the charleston suburbs. liked it well enough there, but always felt like this was home, could never really lean hard into life there. my standard response is ""it's not for everybody."" there are plenty of things that suck about living here, i'm not totally sure this was the right call for us in our middle age years, but..like everywhere else would feel like i was on the outside looking in. literally 10-20 million people exist here just fine. most of the entire globe lives in places like nyc 🤷🏾‍♀️ then don’t i don’t know how i live here either well it depends where. i live eastern long island and it's expensive but so beautiful i wouldn't want to live anywhere else did i ask you? ""sir, this is a wendy's"" that’s right. you couldn’t. so many people scared of nyc for little reason. imo only drawback is cost of living. “oh yeah, not everyone’s mentally strong enough to live in the city. good for you for knowing that about yourself.” non-condescending: “k”. condescending: “not everyone can handle it”.  ultra-condescending: “actually, i really love it here. i’m so happy.” “that’s how i feel about *insert their town*” i live in ny and as soon as i complete my latest project i am out of here and away from houckle. i agree with them. “okay lol i agree ig” native nyer here, i get it. nyc is like david lynch movies, i think they are beautiful, fascinating, and often disturbing masterpieces, but i totally get that some people just wouldn’t like them at all or find them appealing in any way. “we built different” ""yeah only certain kind of people can live here. it has its own way of weeding out the weak"" “same, and i’ve lived there 24 years” well stay where you are then. don’t worry bout it sweetheart. you don't have to respond. let people live in their little world. i agree im not asking for a roomate, uncle mark “i didn’t ask” or “yeah, a lot of people can’t hack it!” mind ya business ""okay leave"" i know this place is a shit hole “i get that” “you’re right, you definitely couldn’t handle it here” i say i understand. i only came here for the art as an artist but that whole crowd is snooty political and male dominated and disgusting so about to leave after 20 years. sick of the abuse and anger, commutes. i feel like the art meca will not be here. a more annoying question is, how do you live there, homeless, dangerous, and so small good literally nothing because i don’t care. just smile. i will tell him straight to his face - “you.. you.. you are totally right and the city became garbage” don’t come ""yeah, i can tell."" whenever tourists at my job say this i just respond with “wow. devastating.” provincial snowflakes, they scared of chocolate colored people good! it's too crowded as it is. good to know your limits i grew up in la and have lived in new york for almost 20 years. i fairly often have a dodgers or lakers hat on and new yorkers fairly often tell me how much they hate la.   i’ve found that responding with “if i wanted your opinion i would have asked you” works pretty well.   same thing works here. you don’t have to make it about where they live, you just have to remind them that just because they have an opinion doesn’t mean they need to share it. ""cause i work here"" is usually my response. lol let me guess, it’s too expensive. “i love it, you don’t have to. it’s not for everyone.” i don’t engage with people like this. it's okay. we don't want you here anyway. ngl i mostly live here because i work here and don't want to commute. my coworkers from li have asked me how i live here, i just ask them what time they had to wake up to get to work and what time they will get home. for them it's 4:10am then they get home around 5:30. i get up at 6:10 and am usually home before 3pm. on the weekends they are usually sleeping in to catch up on sleep, while i'm still waking up at 6:10 feeling refreshed, then head to the beach or mountains. please don’t then. we have enough problems. go and live somewhere where you’re happy and spare us your ignorant opinions ""i didn't choose to be born here."" is what i've told people. because i didn't lol. is this new york the state or new york city. i love my small town in upstate new york. 🎶 🎵 where everybody know your name...🎶 suck my dick nod/smile/walk away “nobody cares” good we got enough people from the middle of nowhere making tik tok videos here “yeah, not everyone has what it takes to succeed here socially or economically” *silence* different strokes for different folks. no need to stoop to something haughty. the same as anywhere else they go to work eat poop reproduce and so on it’s a really great is what i say. but what i think is if you have to ask why nyc you do not only not belong there but you will never get it. this kind of comment is likely not a personal value judgement. nyc is an objectively difficult place to eke out an existence. there are many reasons why someone would say they can’t or don’t want to live here that are in no way derogatory. l + ratio + didn’t ask good. we are full it does completely suck right now, would leave if i could it's a hard city, but you're never bored. everyday feels like a movie good, there's too many people already. we have a housing shortage. i’m sorry there’s no more room. it's pretty much how everyone used to live unless you were a farmer. i feel bad for them. ""i didn't ask"" nyc isn’t for the weak so i understand only the strong survive i simply say ""i like it,"" but i'm thinking [this](https://youtube.com/clip/ugkxb82j_rahxxae3wboxd9robiivk7f_0r2?si=hgwt5vjwoa826fqx). ![gif](giphy|7k2loeyky5i1hfewqb) them:""i could nev-"" me: ""hard agree"" a lot of bitter & sassy answers in this thread. it’s not a personal attack if someone doesn’t want to live here. i moved out of that toilet a long time ago wouldn’t go back for all the money in the world. good. “can i get a #3 with a large soda?” i usually respond with curiosity. oh, what makes you say that? then if they offer a negative assumption that isn’t true (it’s too dangerous, etc) i say, oh that hasn’t been my experience and then they usually stop.  sometimes i’ll say oh yea i get it- i could never live in the rural midwest, we all have our preferences and that also usually stops them   honestly it’s fine if both everyone wants to live here but usually when people say that it’s with a critical edge so i try to shut it down then i guess you shouldn’t. honestly man… i don’t know how i can even live here anymore.  it’s gotten exponentially harder to find a fucking apartment since the last time i moved.  i’ve been couch surfing and subletting since april and i’m completely over it. i have family who are native new yorkers and i’m an la native. we both still reside in our home towns. we laugh about it. they have a choice. stay where you are and why do you care where we live? we do not say anything about where they live. ny and la are always the bullseye on the dartboard. oh well. we don’t want you to live here either. not everyone can 💁🏻‍♀️ i was born and raised here; i agree with them this place is a dump. good. good. don’t come here, we have enough real new yorkers already living here. that i hate it to and feel stuck here to the people who have asked me that, my response was   ""don't believe everything you see in movies or on the news. yes its true we have crime and our mayor sucks but there is more to ny than the 5 boroughs. alot of people live in very beautiful areas that are safe and only commute to manhattan for work"" i tell them we're glad not to have them. i agree: you couldn’t as someone from nyc i’d say i agree 🤣 “yes, as a new yorker i can say it is pretty bad. stay out”. this way, hopefully, we can bring the rent down and enjoy our city with those who love it, like i do. to each their own that’s great, but if you can make it in new york baby, you can make it anywhere. maybe you’re just not cut out to be a boss you weren’t even invited ❤️ stop being a big lippy puss nobody  who lives in the greatest  city in the universe cares..😊😄😁🙂 and plears,please...stay away,your not wanted  and we don't  need you!!!!!😎 a lot of people find nyc overwhelming. i was born here so it's second nature. however, i went to pitt and didn't have a single friend from pittsburgh who successfully tried to transition to nyc. most lasted a year, some a bit longer. you love it or you don't that’s great, don’t good luck, babe ✌️ i tell them they’re right. the city could do much better to take care of its constituents. i shrug and say it’s actually better when you live there. visiting can be stressful, but when you have home to get back to and you generally know your way around, it’s a great place to live. “i agree. it’s unlikely you would be able to make it out here.” not sure that requires any response. ""time is a construct and capitalism is killing us all, i don't know how people live anywhere."" so don’t live here you’re so right! i have a couple of cousins who always make remarks about me living in nyc. i just tell them, ""it's not for the weak"" fuck off. i say i love the energy. it is the capital of the universe. the news o it reports on the crime. very safe. good, leave “yeah you’re right. you probably couldn’t “ it’s not for everyone.   most nyers could never live in really rural areas; same concept. you don’t need a response. i just say it’s not for everybody.i remember a friend told me i need to move out of new york and how bad it is blah blah blah all because she moved to pennsylvania,so i told her it’s not that easy for me to move long story short she ended up getting evicted from her apartment and now she’s back in new york lol. “where else then?” awhile ago, we were afraid that you would move here! “f@ck otf” thank god because we don’t need people like you here lol good, stay out. i would scream that i agree ""yeah, you probably aren't strong enough"". but then they get all mad, so be ready if you say that. “then don’t 😀” this aint for the weak.. keep enjoying  ohio brah i dig it i tell them its a real place with real people just like any other 👍 we lived in nyc for 2 decades as an adult including several years in midtown, after moving out, i don’t think i would want to live there even if someone gave a free apartment. ""i don't know either"" because it's true, i'm not cut out for it & at the same time i don't wanna leave... ""good."" i mean good don’t fucking live here there’s almost 9 million people here. live in your boring suburb of dallas and tweet about your truck and freedom. shut the fuck up and stay there. https://preview.redd.it/uc37pkedd0jd1.jpeg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26c8712ae2b5217ee348bd6cb2538934689d0508 “whatever floats your boat” how about nothing because someone is just giving you a little insight into their preferences.  why is everyone always looking for a reason to be butt hurt?  look for a reason to be grateful, or find joy in things, and touch some grass in central park. we don’t want you here either ""i agree, this place sucks. wish i could leave"" yea i can see that you wouldn’t be a good fit there anyways “cool. don’t.” no need to take offense when people say that. a lot of people don't like the loud city environment and high rent. if you live in ny, you know it's not perfect. my sister says that to me all the time. most of the times, i just smile and change the topic.  but few times i have responded “ i can't live at a place where i have to drive everywhere.  every ones different.” good! don’t! there’s already enough ohio transplants in zara jackets and baggy jeans clogging up the sidewalk. thank god, we dont need anyone like you “that’s fine.”  i totally get it. it isn’t for everyone and that is okay. i love it. sometimes it feels like an abusive relationship, but it is hard to imagine living anywhere else unless it is also a large city where i don’t *need* a car. “did someone ask you to live here?” ""you're right, you could never live here"" scrolling (not all the way so relax) are there any real answers? other than, ""no one asked you to"" or similar (by the way, those people make this place tough to live in 😂)   proximity to nyc, beaches, schools, family, road trip to most of east coast, great jobs? i can totally see why people live there, i just don't understand how you afford to good! it's already too crowded. *internally thinks to self* “idk how i live here either” i just say imagine california. 😂 “and that’s why you don’t” truuue i get don’t get why so many so called new yorkers here in the comments can’t imagine how life in nyc is objectively harder than if we lived anywhere else. like if someone said this to me i’d be like “i know! rent is crazy in nyc”   like it’s not a personal attack, it’s just true. it’s crazy dense, the rent is unbelievable the taxes wild, the proximity and density of humans per block is 5-10x any other us city.   for better or for worse yes we’re all here for a reason, but don’t pretend your quality of life would not improve if you left. it’s not always a put down if someone says they could never live here. it’s a lot! well it’s good you dont “it’s definitely not for the weak” yeah, but are the rats in oklahoma living like kings? didn’t think so. “i know, it’s a horrible city but it’s where my job is.” i would live in ny if i had the money to do it in style. think terrace instead of balcony. great. don’t. i lived in new york and i wish i listened to the people who told me this. the city is a shit-ridden scum factory. people weren't meant to live like that. i rightfully judge people who genuinely enjoy it. me neither then don’t. then don’t move here fine. there’s enough of us here already. shit ain’t easy out here my boy!!!!!! i sometimes think i wouldn't want to if i weren't a native.  but only every other day. just means i'm stronger than you why is this such a common thing for people to say?! i’ve had multiple people say that to me and i’m always so confused. i wouldn’t say that about where they live. depends but sometimes just a “that’s awesome, glad you know that! i dont know how you could live here either. :)” to each their own. it’s not for the weak. the city doesn't need anymore transplants trying to live their best ""friends,"" ""sex and the city,"" or ""broad city"" lifestyle, so it's okay!👌🏾 same. it’s an over expensive pile of litter and smells like garbage. cool museums and parks though and fun for day trips! you’re right; you couldn’t ""it's not for the weak"" are the majority of the people answering this question  transplants? how many people are talking to people that don't live here? most of friends and family are from here. how often are you guys getting asked this question? and by whom? “i respect your opinion.” i agree my response is always “yeah it sucks.” because it does. i’m convinced most of you have a fantasy image of what this city is based on movies and tv that clouds your perception of reality.",189,544,neutral,0.420522004365921,733,"i would never live in (suburban town)"" i think people think you're being rude if you say ""i could never live in (big city)"" b. i want to keep rent down b. i want to keep my house clean c. i want to keep my house clean d. i want to keep my house clean e. i want to keep my house clean f. i want to"
96,"$800/month studio, $10,000 broker fee","wow assuming this is rent stabilized, if you renew even once it’s worth it. the broker fee spread over 12 months is $833.33 for a net price of $1633.33 for the first year, not too bad for a studio…and then once you renew, it’s an $800 studio apartment.  if it’s not rent stabilized, you’re effectively paying half the rent upfront, which could be worth it with the caveat that they can raise the rent to anything and you may have to move anyway. $800 for a large studio is a unicorn. even with the brokers fee you’ll literally be paying less than 20k a year your first year in rent for a large studio with good natural lighting and in a location you like. and then next year you’ll be paying less than 10k in rent for it.   if i were looking for a studio and my rental budget was anywhere near 1.6k a month i’d be first in line to apply for this. literally the income requirement for it would be $32k or 64k with a guarantor. students and interns with a decent budget would beg for this. over 1 years rent broker fee is absolutely bananas i suspect this is a rent stabilized apartment and there has been reports of brokers doing this.  [https://gothamist.com/news/a-rent-stabilized-1-bedroom-apartment-for-1100-in-nyc-the-brokers-fee-is-15k](https://gothamist.com/news/a-rent-stabilized-1-bedroom-apartment-for-1100-in-nyc-the-brokers-fee-is-15k)  you probably would have to fork up the fee then complain and hope you get some of the money back. if you see you self doing this for a long time, then its probably worth it. it’s exploitative, but unfortunately this ain’t the first time i'm an agent and that is 100% bs. at most that fee should be $1440 which is 15% of.the annual..doesn't matter if it's rent stabilized or not. that's crazy. you should.report them to rebny if they even are, but definitely report them to the ny dept of state. i freaking hate hearing about these people, and i'm in the biz. don’t do it. this shit is the reason why nyc housing is a dumpster fire. also, as a former landlord attorney, you better check the dhcr records to make sure the $800 rent is the legal rent of the unit. my suspicion is that the broker is subsidizing your annual rent to cover some issue going on in with the building. could be bed bugs, could be the landlord just looking to churn tenants to increase the market value of the unit, but if the rent is not registered at $800 with dhcr, you’ll probably be in for a real nasty surprise when your lease is up for renewal and you catch a lease with a legal rent at $2300. if the building have infestations then you will have infestations. but now you’ll feel stuck in that place because you dropped $10k on it. and your landlord won’t help you because there’s no money in it for them anymore. it will suck big time. i wouldn’t do it. take the apt and then report the broker to the state: https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/01/25/city-wide-apartments-paying-260k-after-broker-fee-controversy/ which neighborhood is the studio in?  which broker office is it, so we know who to avoid being gouged by. unpopular opinion but this is worth it even if you are only staying for 1 year.   it’s hard finding anything under 20k per year as is. ideally you stay for 2 years and you make out like a bandit i’d laugh at anyone who pays that fee that’s what i would do i would love if we eventually got rid of brokers and real estate agents do it it can be negotiated this smells off if any part of the building is infested, the whole building is infested. do you value saving money (however much of a deal it is over the course of multiple years) over living with vermin in your apartment? if there are roaches in units and they’re not being dealt with in the entire building, they will soon be your problem too. i would check the building history with the department of buildings, alongside asking the broker/landlord/whoever what kind of renovations were done. you’d be surprised how many “updates” require a permit, a licensed professional to do work, and/or a certificate of occupancy after work is completed.  check it [here](https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bispi00.jsp)  all that aside, $800 for a rent stabilized unit near prospect park sounds too good to be true, especially one that is “renovated.” renovations are costly, and i doubt whatever renovations your unit had would be offset or justified by a rent of $800.   renovations are more or less done to increase property value, but if the owner/landlord can’t even make use of that investment by charging more, it is often seen as impractical and therefore unfavorable. basically, no landlord in their right mind would renovate a unit just to charge $800 a month, while knowing that they will be legally capped on rent increases every year.   lastly, check this [site](https://apps.hcr.ny.gov/buildingsearch/) to see if the building in question has rent regulated (controlled or stabilized) units that are registered with ny state. it wont tell you which units specifically, but it’s a good way to know if the building does indeed have rent regulated units. if you really want to know if the specific unit is regulated, fill out this [form.](https://portal.hcr.ny.gov/app/ask) roaches and mice do not care if a place is newly renovated, they will get in. roaches will find your way into your apartment even if renovated. it means they are in the pipes and walls. pretty sure the state forced brokers who charged insane broker fees like this on rent stabilized apartments to return the fees.     so, you could take the apartment, file a complaint with the state and profit :) you can use all the money you are saving to feed the mice and rat kingdom living with you. [removed] the rent stabilized, and this broker fee - “gratitude” to super, a common story if it sounds too good to be true.. comment was made 14 hours ago. this apartment is already gone. 😂 no wayyy. where? lmao what!! sounds like a scam try and find the contact of the landlord and see if you can rent directly from them, some landlords wont, but i've known a few people who were able to do that to avoid a high brokers fee that’s illegal mate if you’re not going to take it do come back to us. aren’t bugs everywhere? like unless you are on the 30th floor of a new high rise? i’m 5-5 with roaches, and 2-5 with rats. 🐀 rats love basement that’s why i have finally ruled the. out for me. what's the address boss? are you sure the broker and landlord are actually legit? people have been scammed by fakers pretending to rent in buildings they have no ties to.  then they take your deposit, fees, etc. on the day they're supposed to hand over keys,  split with your deposit, rent and fees. where do you look up reviews?  also, holy shit. i own my apartment and my maintenance fee is higher than that this can’t be legal…esp with that big supreme court case…anyone a real lawyer, not just on reddit? do it. in my opinion, you’ll come out ahead compared to other going rates after a year or two. what if they find a stupid reason to kick you out so they can collect another 10k from someone else? better than buying if you want to stay in a shitty apartment forever sure. does anyone know if the reason why this level of broker’s fee is because they’re giving a kickback of this fee to the  landlord because they can’t up the rent on the stabilized apt? or would that be illegal? how is stuff like this not illegal? the real pest problem are the brokers and their fees. hopefully the new legislation passes and wipes this bs out. all u need is 1 neighbor yelling all day for no reason and u wish to run away     or the roaches 🪳 get u    renovations would probably just be slapping on some paint and calling it a day 😐 typical landlord special give it the illegals and pass. if it sounds wrong, it probably is wrong.  don’t do it. i did same thing.  paid a years rent fee for a rent stabilized lease.  that was in 1999 - still there! what’s a capartment? 🤪😆🤣 worth it !!!! i have been in my rent stabilized 27 years .. and is about 1/3 of market cost now never pay broker fees. ever. nah man if you search on your own you can find apartment don’t require brokers fee, that’s literally moving money or can go to something else. if this is a legitimate stabilized studio that suites your needs you are an absolute fool not to take this deal. i’ve seen roaches in new developments and in my own apartment. it’s a new york thing and the best way to get around it is don’t leave food out and clean your floors. i would not do this. absolute scam. do you mind dm me the broker’s contact and address? i want to check something. my kid got that. it’s a scam saw it in person or saw it on tik tok?

97,one has to laugh,"sounds like you dodged a bullet there. it was no fee and was on the market for a month? it must have been pretty bad, if that's the case crazy to think that just 3 years ago that landlord wouldve been doing everything they could to get you in there. now they're just like, fuck you pay me. such apartments may often go to the younger folks, born outside nyc with wealthy parents in low cost of living states. the kid moves to nyc, parents pay for that nightmare you saw, and after a year of hell, the kid goes to a nicer place with roommates after making some friends, or goes home to where they came from with plenty of negative things to say about nyc for their youtube and tiktok channels. hahaha i guess “enough interest in the place” was in the room after all welcome to nyc, it’s overpriced and you have to make $150k or you get laughed out the room yeah brokers don't really give any shits about the renter. if you pass there's a long lineup of other renters who will take it you can also just have a portable washer/dryer at any apartment, sure, some leases forbid them, but just be ready to throw it in a closet whenever anyone swings by the place. i've had one for the last 5 years without any issues.",185,41,negative,0.5695748329162598,226,"and i've had it for the last 5 years without any issues. i'm not sure about the washer/dryer, but i've had one for the last 5 years without any issues. i'm not sure what you did to get in there. sounds like you dodged a bullet there. it was no fee and on the market for month? crazy... now"
98,How hard should I hold on to my apartment?,"rent stabilization and close to the park is a steal for that price, i see prices creeping up to 4k plus for a two bedroom close to the park in a new luxury building, don’t ever leave unless you have to. the area is going up and up, you’ll be hard pressed to find another deal i wouldn’t leave , that’s a very very sweet deal. look for someone to replace the roommate instead! plenty of people looking, otherwise yeah just bite the bullet and fork out the 2k yourself. thats around what studios and one bedrooms are going for these days. i live in kensington and i’m about to be paying $1950 for my large one bedroom. definitely hold onto your place you have an incredible deal. keep it until you have to commute somewhere not as easy… think it depends on if you want to stay in the area long term. how is it rent stabilized if a new building? if you end up deciding to move i would be happy to take the lease off your hands! : d your situation is pretty great. why not get another roommate? look for another roommate to move in. i used to live in that area and that sounds like a deal. that sounds amazing especially with the easy commute to work. i definitely wouldn't leave. stay. don’t leave! make it work :) keep the damn apartment!! what are you crazy?!?  also, get another roommate- duh!! i don’t understand these posts “hey guys so we all know the housing market is shit, but i live in an obscenely inexpensive rent stabilized unit in a growing and sought after neighborhood, surrounded by transportation and easily walkable to my work or the park,  that i can reasonably afford with my savings or a roommate! should i move?!” like… what do you think? look online for what something similar would cost. 2 bedrooms with no amenities are $2600 minimum and up, often $3000 and up. hold on to it for sure rent stabilized, new building, 2 bedroom central air and an actual outdoor porch in a safe brooklyn neighborhood 2050 a month? just read that again and you have your answer. so lucky 🍀 don't be stupid, hold on to it. you got all of amenities that most people dream about at very reasonable price.   i did the whole buying a house because 1. i have lived in the area for 40+ years and didn't want to be priced out 2. my gross income disqualified me for a rent stabilized unit. all of the rentals i looked at were 500 sq. for the same payment as my mortgage. i would stay. after you graduate and get a full-time job it will be so much easier for you financially. your income will increase but the rent will remain stabilized and wont increase that much. and it's a great deal. if you leave, you'll most likely be paying more for less. struggling for a bit now will pay off in the end. that’s a stupid good deal and i’d never leave, but it’s not a great deal for you if you’re going to bleed money. if you can afford it by using some-not-all of your savings, temporarily, i’d hold on to it can your current roommate leave their bedroom room furniture? if yes, rent it out for a few months at a time. roommates for 6 months then take 6 months off instead of using your savings. it is easy to find temporary roommates when the room they are taken is furnish. i would plan to die in that apartment. hold on loosely but don’t let go. stay and get a sublet/roommate if you ever choose to give it up, i will take it! find a new roommate. if i were you i'd hold out for a gorgeous gourmet chef. stay. i know the kensington, w.t. park slope areas very well. if you give up that deal you will regret it down the road. since a room is $1500 i’d stay. $2 k is a lot but you have your own place. i’d stay and do whatever it takes to pay the rent. get a roommate keep it! rent out a room for for a month at a time if you need to coverage. hold on to a rs apartment that you love for dear life sounds like a great deal, i'd keep it.  i assume you can't sublet? pry it out of your dead, cold hands. no question. real hard! don’t you dare move! doesn’t have to be a stranger. maybe someone you know is also looking for a place to live. fookin 'ell m8 i'd be your roommate i promise all i do is go to work go home chill in my room 😎👏👍 you’ll never ever ever get a cheaper place ever again not now. this is a housing crisis with the lowest availability in 50 years. hold! lol you should be able to find another roommate within a few days at that price. i was gonna say the roommate situation will not be hard if he decides to leave !! dont leave hold on to that dear apartment cause that's an absolute steal! and hit me up if you're looking for a roommate! you can post on listings project to find a roommate - i feel like the potential roomies you’d find on there might be a safer bet than posting on craigslist for example don’t leave! get me to be your roommate!! i’d keep it, you’re not getting outdoor space and 2 actual bedrooms for anything close to that unless you find another stabilized unit, which is very hard to do.   on that note i’d also look up the nature of the rent stabilization of the property and when that expires, if it does.  as some have mentioned already, this is probably a 421a building which means it has a tax abatement for x years and post x years the units are no longer stabilized. i live one block from the park and have a 3br for 2k in a rent stabilized apt :) i love my area not hard and just give it to me my wife and i also live in the city in a rent stabalized building. we pay $1500 rent and it increases by around $30 a year or so. large, spacious apartment with walk in closet, dining room table in kitchen, dishwasher, elevator, windows facing 3 directions etc.  we are taking this thing to the grave. having your rent be 1/10th of your take-home salary is something that people have literally killed for. get a roommate. don’t put them on the lease. charge them market rate (not your stabilized deal pricing.) don’t tell them what you pay.   carefully select a roommate that you know will leave nyc. student, travel nurse, model. if you want someone to rent two weekends a month when/if the other guy moves i live out of state but come to the city sometimes.

100,List of landlords you SHOULD rent from,"ray simone - williamsburg, very humble guy. has refused to raise rents on his tenants even though he could the best landlord you can hope for is one that actually follows the laws and regulations as they are written. they are actually pretty few and far between eberhart brothers has been very good for such a large company i’ll say. my second year with them now most of the landlords you’re seeking are small , three family owners like mine. i won’t tell you where i rent, and i’m assuming the other owners won’t. i’ll live here til i die kibel and rose properties are both totally fine. i was able to get apartments with both directly from the landlord and avoid broker fees.  they are both corporately run and have dealt with any issues swiftly, i never had any headaches with either. can be hit or miss i guess, but having just a private owner as my landlord instead of a property management company has been amazing if they own over 5 properties, chances are high they’ve screwed a lot of people over to get to where they’re at, the sad reality here >do good landlords exist?   not really, no. you can find one who isn’t personally evil—but the industry is draconian,it incentivizes dehumanization/profits over people. best management companies imo, and i have lived all over manhattan for years. brodsky and tf cornerstone. always well kept, great staff. prime square realty - following a horrendous landlord last year, these have been a breath of fresh air. super supportive and helpful throughout the process, they've fixed any issue we have within 24 hours. ivan the handy man is brilliant. and rent was only raised $50. i’ve had good experiences with tf cornerstone and smart management. i think overall people have better experiences with smaller (but experienced) landlords generally. always run a google/court search for the name.   my personal experience - i mean it’s not… affordable? but doable on a dink income… i’ve lived at several bozzuto properties both in and outside of nyc and i’ve never had a problem with management, maintenance/repairs, pest control, smells, loud neighbors, etc. no brokers fees at any (went right through the leasing office). returned security deposits on time. which with the way landlords are, works for me lol. manocherian brothers. management are always responsive, fix things quickly (e.g. new fridge in one day when ours broke on a saturday), reasonable rent increases (2-3% a year, i think 5% the one year after covid where everyone else was getting crazy rent hikes), rent is lower than similar buildings in our neighborhood zev zafir/mr sthuel were the landlords i rented from for years in wburg, my old roomie is still at the apartment. would def rent from him again, super reasonable, hasn’t done more than a $50/yr rent raise on us since 2017 and has excellent maintenance & pest control guys. berman realty in brooklyn! family owned, show up instantly if there are any problems, reasonable rent increases. best landlords i’ve had. my landlord has been fine overall our super just kinda sucks. he’s great at cleaning the place but never fixes anything and at this point i’m pretty certain he’s just not a good handyman and doesn’t know how. i’m in my second year, was a $50 rent increase this year. could be a lot worse off. anywhere sub $2500 for a 1 bed is a deal nowadays, sadly. i had a great experience with top quality management for a couple of years before my building changed to 360 management- they are horrible and i would stay away but tqm was great ! this was in brooklyn top 5 based on openigloo data https://www.openigloo.com/blogs/top-5-big-residential-landlords-in-nyc-2023",180,45,positive,0.7529032826423645,225,i would stay away from them. i would stay away from top quality management- they are horrible and i would stay away but tqm was great ! i would stay away from 360 management- they are horrible and i would stay away but top quality management was great ! i would stay away from 360 management- they are horrible and i would stay away but tqm was great ! i would stay away from 360 management-

103,Age-Old Problem ,"i don't want to leave the city if i'm fortunate enough to be able to retire. i think living in a city provides more access to health, and culture, and opportunities. it also has public transportation which as you get older is important.    glad you were able to find something, after all. most of us aren’t confident we’ll ever get our social security but that 75k a year must be nice you can't afford a $4,500 a month apartment on your income and savings. the rule is generally 4% withdrawal to make up for inflation and to hedge against volatility, so that would be about $40k a year on your $1 million. with your $75k ss, that would give you $115k or $2,875 a month using the 40x rule, which is a far cry from the $4,500 that you think you can afford.  additionally, you say that $200k of your $1 million is in cash and not in the market, which would mean that you'd be able to consistently pull even less investment income than $40k a year without running out or having inflation make it worth less. you're only seeing this issue from your pov.  the ll likely has the following issues, none of which are created by the ll:  a) evictions in nyc are extremely difficult. if you've priced your apt right you'll have multiple applications and always go with the person that is most qualified.  b) you may view yourself as most qualified bc you have $1m in the market. you can spend or lose that money tomorrow. once upon a time, a ll would ask someone in your position to pay, say, 6 months rent up front. that's now illegal. so ll will go with the person who can show 40x income.  c) those guarantor services have fine print that states if the tenant defaults on rent, the guarantor service can find a tenant - any tenant - and the ll has to accept that tenant or the guarantee is no good. not very attractive to a ll  as a side note, keep in mind if you were going for a mortgage, the bank would treat you the same way as the ll. they wouldn't excuse a shortage of income bc you have $1m. they would still require you to meet dti thresholds.   anyways, glad you found a place in the end. while i can't relate, a former housemate was a retiree and brokers/landlords were definitely cool with their income source. but this was pre-pandemic. my guess is it's a numbers game and you need to keep applying. your numbers don't add up but as long as you got a deal at the end that's all that matters. why would you rent a 4500 apartment on 75k a year? 1 million can go easily. it doesn’t make sense the landlords are right and i’m not a landlord but it doesn’t work out to being able to pay. that's why it's so important for people who want to retire in nyc to own. no bullshit hoops for you to jump through. it sucks the tenant picking requirements right now trust me!! finally secured a place that i sign for on sunday. prior to that ive been applying and looking with my gf for 1.5 months! i alone make the 40x income requirement and she makes about 50-60k a year as well. her credit is 700 but mine is low because of past mistakes in like the mid 5s area. we were denied left and right solely off of my credit alone. i said so we have almost 190k combined income, paystubs etc. and she has a 700 score.. but because of my 550 score ur telling us we cant rent a 1 bedroom for $2300?! it is so stupid! my mom is retired with about the same as you on paper, she put my name on her accounts which works the exact same as being a spouse, and i was 4 days away from being homeless trying to find an apartment under $3k. they are freaking brutal with the incomes. hi, i am glad you found a place you love.   this is one of those situations where having an agent might have helped. i think had you gone in with better information the process could have been less surprising.  it's true different owners regard retirees differently. i have had some need to use third party, and others approved without it.   it's also true that many owners still don't feel completely comfortable with third party guarantors, though i am not sure exactly what the root of the resistance is.   but in the end you have a beautiful rent stabilized apartment with an extra half bath, and that sounds wonderful! i’m surprised you were able to get the rent stabilized place. no landlord will rent a rent stabilized apartment to someone 62 or older if they have other options. it’s next to impossible to evict an elderly tenant age 62 or older and there are senior citizen rent increase exemptions (scrie) that you could possibly be eligible for, which means any landlord doing the math will figure out that you are a bad bet. the good cause eviction law that went into effect in april of 2024 also means that landlords are intensifying their screening of tenants because it’s harder than ever to evict someone. glad you found a place. all of the protections passed have unfortunately made it difficult for those protected to get approved. thanks for sharing your story, as i will need to look for a new apt as a retiree with working spouse whose income alone won’t qualify. while i get why landlords are careful, retirement income, robust liquidity, and strong investments, with exceptional credit rating, are far more secure than current employment, when so many are being laid off. it seems some landlords are too simple-minded to consider atypical situations. glad you found a terrific place! just throwing this out there but the housing connect website also does housing purchase lotteries.  combine that with a first homeowners loan if you qualify, might just be the thing to do. check out their website. this is all a pretty normal experience for people in your shoes. does it suck? yes... however, there's no changing it late 60s here. you need at lease 80x the rent in assets for the management company to be happy. how is your credit rating? i worked with a broker as i was originally going to buy. it turned out it was good to have an advocate when i decided to rent instead. it is definitely tough out there. gook luck can i ask how you find rent stabilized apartments? really appreciate all the input here.  just want to add a footnote to the story.  we found the listing on street easy, which i understand costs a broker $60 a day for each ad. we saw the ad, toured the apartment with the broker who was the exclusive broker for the ll and applied all in one day. the tour was about 15 minutes. i estimate the broker spent about two hours working with us on filling out the application, which was managed on a complicated website.  once we hit ""send"" the appointment came within 30 minutes on a sunday no less.   the fee was 15 percent of the first year's rent -- over $6.5k. typical i know, but not a bad haul for less than a day's work selling a unicorn people would kill for. that’s so frustrating—seems like common sense would go a long way in these situations! glad you found a great place in the end, but it’s wild how rigid some landlords can be, even when the financials clearly add up glad you eventually found a great spot, but it’s wild how rigid some landlords can be with those policies. you’d think a solid financial cushion like yours would speak louder than income ratios this is literally why i bought a house outside of the city. it’s so invasive and wrongheaded. who knows what nyc landlords will be asking for in 30 years when i’m retired. i took a year off from work to rest and relied on my savings. when i started apartment hunting while also job searching, i had $40k in savings. while i'm actively job searching. i was looking with roommates who were gainfully employed. we all had good credit. the savings didn't even matter to landlords. i could literally pay for the entire unit myself for a year, and they wanted me to get a guarantor 🙄🙄🙄🙄 also tax return had me showing i made over $100k. when i'm employed, i make $$. i'm looking for a job. i have the $$ to right now.  they didn't even care. denied denied denied uws?

neighborhood. there are cheap places to rent in every borough. you just have to know how to find them and you have to get a little bit lucky.   here’s one approach i’d recommend:  1.) download a bunch of housing apps to your phone. streeteasy, hot pads, spareroom, zillow rentals, craigslist, facebook, and apartment list are a good start. even this subreddit gets great listings sometimes. some of these apps are better than others thougj. over time you can delete the ones that are not as useful to your search. a good goal is to figure out what rooms/apartments in various areas are going for. at this stage you’re doing market research and these are tools that can help you do that so you can figure out where to prioritize your time searching.  2.) the most risky sites can have the best deals. craigslist is the best example. its full of listings made by people who are trying to scam you. it’s also full of legitimate listings by tenants and landlords trying to rent a room in their apartment. the way you can decipher between the two is just by reading a bunch of listings and gauging what sounds like it’s coming from a legitimate person versus a scammer. scammers are on every website though, and some scammers are more sophisticated than others. so keep your guard up and trust your instincts. don’t rent a place without seeing it first.  3.) use filters. you’ll be a lot more successful on all these sites if you use filters. put your maximum budget but also put a minimum if you can, so you filter out a lot of the junk that’s priced too good to be true. also sort by recent listings and specify a zip code or neighborhood if you have one in mind. for your situation, if you’re using craigslist for example, i would suggest putting your minimum budget as $600 and your max at say $1100. whatever seems right for your situation. this way you can focus your limited energy on listings that are more likely to be legit.  4.) reach out and visit apartments. if you want to eventually rent a place, you have to get used to visiting apartments, asking good questions to landlords, tenants, real estate companies, etc., and determining if you can see yourself living in a certain apartment. start a note on your phone somewhere and start writing questions you’ll want to ask to those who show you a place.  5.) get your documents ready. have everything in a folder on your computer (ideally in a cloud based application). copies of your id, bank statements, tax returns, credit report, w2s, savings accounts, etc. different people will ask for different documents. rooms move quick and you want to give yourself every advantage you can get.  6.) research places regularly. it depends on the urgency you have with wanting to move. at the peak of my most recent apartment search i was looking at multiple sites/apps multiple times per day each.  7.) do research before signing a lease. there are sites available to verify if an address is legit, if the apartment or unit has any previous issues, if the landlord is overbearing, etc. the more knowledge you have the better you’ll set yourself up for finding a place you love.  this isn’t an exhaustive list. i’m sure others could add more. good luck with your search! you have to do what everyone else does in the service industry in the most expensive cities in the world. they either find a tiny room on the outskirts with a bunch of roommates or they commute to their job.  this is nyc, tokyo, london, any of the big metropolitan first world cities. there isn't any trick or solution to it, other than to make more money. if you are open to commuting then queens is usually the cheapest option.  but honestly i would stay with my mom as long as possible dude. if your home life isn’t a bad situation then stay and save as much as you can. i always tell young people that if they get along with their parents and it’s not a bad situation to stay as long as possible and save. this is the way. look for a roommate situation. it's doable! keep building experience, keep saving. it's still possible to find cheap rooms to rent in washington heights, but i think you should try to transfer to something that pays a higher hourly than that. 18 per hour is egregiously low for this city.  bear in mind you're going to need first month's rent and security deposit to move anywhere, and i think you should be looking to pay no more than $850 per month. people are going to say that doesn't exist, but i think with roommates it can still be found in deep washington heights or the bronx.  even as a cater waiter you can make $21-35 an hour with no experience. i think office work pays much better long term if you can keep working on learning new skillsets in excel and other software, but if you're desperate to move out see if you can find cater waiter work to pick up shifts on the weekends---september through december is the busy season for banquets. you could consider a studio apartment in jersey city. they seem to run about $1500/month. but as others have said, stay at home so you can save. even if you’re only home one more year, you can save a lot. also, a second job would help build up your savings while also keeping you out of your home (i.e., away from a situation you feel is detrimental to your mental health). this sub is infuriating, i’m going to mute it. it’s been fun. ✌🏼 if you’re ok with brooklyn and able to find roommates there are lots of affordable places around the church ave b train stop and a few stops south think of the maximum number of roommates you can stand living with and then add two more. i'm assuming you make 36,000 a year, which means you could rent a room for 900/month. if you can find a 900/month room, which i think you probably could, you could afford it. with an extra $1000 to spend, you wouldn't be living large but you could get by. it's possible but it will be difficult. you can probably live in jackson heights or flushing and share an apartment with 2-3 people. if you know how to cook and are okay with not going out much you could do ok. at $18/hr you're looking for a bedroom that's around $900 maximum. you cant find anything with what you make. unless you suck it up and work 2 jobs. both making over 20 an hour. most you can afford is to share a room. stack your chips in the meantime while you're home i don't see anyone recommending new jersey, places just across the river can be a lot less than even in queens or brooklyn, and some of the neighborhoods are quite nice. if you live on one of the bus lines that go into port authority or path train lines into penn station you could walk to bryant park from either. it would also still be easy enough to socialize in most of manhattan and western queens/brooklyn. rent will be your biggest expense so it might be worth looking in nj too to keep it as low as possible. $18/hr is less than $40k a year. you cannot live in the five boroughs with that salary, even with roommates.  but it's okay, you can definitely find a room in a non trendy part of nj, like bayonne, newark, or the less desirable parts of jersey city. with the path and the light rail, you'll have a pretty easy commute and a much higher standard of living than what you would get in nyc. that puts you at about 37k, which means you can qualify to spend up to $925 or so, which is going to be super tough. if you can find somewhere are really need to, do it. but maybe consider waiting until you can qualify to spend more and continue saving everything is going to be ok, as it is temporary. why don’t you try to look for a night time job or a side hustle? while waiting for a raise you can just look for extra income. that will also keep you out your house most of the day so you don’t have to deal with whatever bullshit at home.   then you can save money and move out. roommates aren’t the best sometimes, but if you find a living situation with cool ppl that you can tolerate, that would be the best option. cause having your own apartment is very costly as well as taking care of yourself.   i live in queens, next to manhattan. not far at all and the prices are close. maybe you should look in another borough like brooklyn or queens that’s close to manhattan. hope some of these thoughts help you on your journey. wish you the best of luck get a second job.  make more than your spending. $2880 is what you get from a 40 hour work week with $18/hr. you need to get a room. that’s prob 1200. you need to pay taxes. you’re in the ballpark for a room. but it’s gonna be a sacrifice in some ways. my suggestion? save the rent for a few years.  and choose to live at home with your parents. and do something with a years worth of rent so that you maybe don’t have to rent or at least save some savings. and hopefully get a higher salary by whatever choice you choose. but no i don’t think moving out at your salary makes sense. at least not unless you have to. op i’m not sure of how old you are but are you in school or at least a trade school?  without concrete skills or a trade it will be extremely difficult to take care of yourself .  perhaps consider jobcore or americorps? there are also other city sponsored programs for young people not doing traditional university straight to the circlejerk sub no way around it, you need to get a job that pays 40+/hr to move out and it likely won't be by bryant park. you don’t. nope, stay where you are especially if your pay raises is so low regardless of overtime. man , i make over 40 an hour and can’t afford it.. can’t even afford jc or hoboken you can definitely move out if you get a roommate or two look in the washington heights area. harlem. near the b/d, i was making that-ish (a little bit more with tips) when i moved in bartending, you can find a bedroom in a 2-3 bedroom apartment for 1000-1400 pretty easily and with some budgeting it comes out to 30-50% of your income and can work out. there are plenty of rooms in your area and even below (hamilton heights/manhattanville) for as low as $850-900, so it’s doable. but a better option would be to find a higher paying job first try queens you will have to look hard and find a roommate. since rents on the reg require you to make 40xs the rent to even see a place. i know there are reasonable places that do exist even in the heights or further uptown. check your credit score and  find a roommate or a place that is looking for a roommate you have to keep looking and be diligent about it. apply on housing connect for anything that is in your range as well, apply for.everything you can apply for, you never know.you may be one of the lucky ones whose number comes up quickly. section 8 opened up  for a bit i don't know if it is still open apply there. most importantly make sure your credit score is good and you are putting away saving while you are living with your mum. you will need it for moving and seriously figure out what you can afford. nyc market is difficult, the outer boros are just as bad too esp areas closer to manhattan.  wishing you much luck. i worked minimum wage jobs for what seems like forever. i would take on little side hustles for extra money. live poor, have trustworthy roommates, and life will be a little tough but still great. it's possible. i was struggling on $73k a year honestly, i'd sign up for a bunch of the affordable housing lotteries 18 a hr isn't enough for nyc unless you get yourself another situation where u can be a roomie or rent a room. but you can try yonkers, metro north goes there and it shouldn't be a bad commute to bryant park. look for apartments renting rooms with 2 or 3 other roommates. it is possible to pay 700 or 800 a month in less desirable areas. in queens i'm thinking corona, woodhaven, ozone park. you’re gonna need to find roommates get a roommate and look for something in sunnyside or woodside. easy and quick to get to bryant park on the 7, and close to astoria and greenpoint for nightlife without having to go into the city. look for an apartment or a roommate situation in queens or brooklyn. i live in queens and survive most of the past couple of years on a pay close to yours. depending how far away from the train you are it will be an hour or so to get to bryant park. i am very frugal and also while working for a low wage live in a basement apartment if that's something you're willing to do. unfortunately what i've been doing at 19 hr is a) being with roomates and b) barely making ends meet. i ended up getting side hustles and other work, but its defintely rough. i got a unlimited metro since i work 2/3 hours away and it does save up in the long run, bites in the short-term though. i usually find places/good rooms via word of mouth or hotpads. wish you the best op i sent you a housing resource via dm living in a van down by the river. honestly you can’t afford nyc on $18 maaaaaaybe with lots of roommates start applying to all the housing lotteries on housing connect. with this salary you likely qualify for a lot of low rent studios across the city. typical max you should pay on housing is 30% of your salary. so your rental budget is $864. there are lottery apartments below that number. you can definitely find a room in queens that you can afford just wanna say—despite not having much specific advice—i want to encourage you to stick it out, and you will be okay and find awesome housing. it may not look or go exactly how you envision it, but if you keep working toward that goal it will happen eventually. give it a couple more years if you need to. finally moved out of my mom’s in bk this year (i’m 29 and had moved back in most recently when i was 25). i wasn’t able to save much in my situation (she charged me rent), but i got a good deal and i was able to prepare a lot/build my career. it was emotionally extremely difficult to live there that long, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel! tbh it’s also very tough to struggle to afford housing in your own city and then have outsiders tell you that maybe you shouldn’t live there. but you can make it happen! shit i just joined the military to get away from my parents and now i get to go to uni for free i don’t even think you can afford anywhere in nyc by living with roommates with 18/h…. 30/h, you can live with a roommate, 50/h, you can live alone. i think. i used to live in washington heights. i would stay in the area; maybe consider going closer to harlem, if anything. i think the heights is one of the few areas where you can still find a room that is somewhat reasonably priced with your budget. do you have a college degree?  if you don’t, i’d suggest going away to school, getting your degree, then coming back to nyc.  almost impossible to live here and get ahead without a degree. there is no way, go get another job jersey city! not possible, sorry these are the most shitty responses that i've ever seen. y'all either aren't reading or have 0 compassion. reddit is a cesspool because of people like you.   anyways.  here's what i recommend.  if you're really not being abused at home, then i suggest you stay and save up. this way, you can have 1st months rent and a security deposit. also, build credit if you don't have any. so let's say $5000 cash saved, that will take 3 months if you're aggressively saving and working full time and over time.   cut out unnecessary expenses, and apply for a discover credit card. if you don't get approved, apply for the secured card. also, download kickoff, self, and similar apps. do your research. credit builders don't make you magically responsible.   put small bills like a netflix subscription or your phone bill on your cards. this way, you have multiple lines of credit. some apps may give you a loan. just pay it back on time, and your credit score will be 700+. this is the cheat code to life as you can now finance anything.   if you are being abused at home, whether it's physically or verbally, then you have options. you can either go get a studio or a 1 bed room. these are very expensive in new york and it can be done at your salary, but most people just live in bigger apartments with roommates.  you can go to a homeless shelter and get services. trust me, there are really good shelters and really shitty ones. depending on how old you are, you will get treated better if you're younger, specifically 18 - 23. for parents, path is best. if you're a single male or a couple, afic is your best bet. only domestic partnership and marriage can prove you're a couple.  you also get treated better if you have a spouse, domestic partner, or child.  i also recommend that you do this in conjunction with switching careers. i personally would get into tech because of the massive opportunities. even non technical roles are better paid. there are also paid internships and apprenticeships. i suggest a free boot camp. for young people, that's marcy lab school. for everyone else, per scholas. i'm african american, so i recommend tech is the new black youtube channel and boot camp. i'm not sure if it's free or paid, though.   if you need anything else, just dm me. look into union jobs with benefits you want a career not a job start stripping lol i’m 3 years living at home now also with parents in nyc, was looking to move out for so long with and *my dream* without roommates. i make about 24 an hour, i couldn’t find a good situation with my friends that i was comfortable with and got a bit stuck. i also don’t have a good living situation with effects on mental health. i’ll manifest for u and me both! yes, if you're working 40 hours a week, and if your budget is really tight. i pay $1275/mo in washington heights making $16 an hour, but i have two jobs and work almost 50 hours a week. you will not have money to go out but if it's worth it to get out of your parents place it's worth it. you are definitely going to need a guarantor, and probably multiple roommates unless your mom is violent just stay as long as you can and save money, gain experience & education.  roommate situations can be awful. i make 140k and can hardly afford to live here lmao queens/jackson heights ain’t a possibility? unfortunately 18 an hour just doesn’t afford the city. its possible if you reallllly keep your eyes peeled for a shared apartment for about 1k a month. you wanna make sure u have savings and also income for ur needs. it will be tough but its possible. u just have to be careful not to get scammed but u can prob look in upper manhatthan or even brooklyn/queens. but ur commute might be a lil more than 40 mins for that rent. a shorter commute to there would be more expensive rent for sure. living in a 200k a year and still surviving living in the bronx but my case kinda different i got kids off topic but an office job in midtown paying 18-20/hr sounds borderline unethical.  heck, the panda express in midtown pays 21.50/hr can you find a roommate? are you open to roommates? i would start talking to friends or acquaintances and look to find someplace together if you’re in a rush, check out spare room and see if anything’s in your price range move out of nyc, problem solved if moving out is the goal it’s gonna be super difficult near your work area.   consider. jersey city or bronx or queens sad reality of life i live in jersey city myself.  currently share an apartment with a couple of roommate’s.  my rent per month is around 700-800 depending on utilities. i don't recommend spending more than 30% of your income on rent, as it will leave you working only for basic needs. besides meeting your needs, your salary should also allow you to save. try looking in the union city area of new jersey you can catch a bus to the port authority from there pretty easy and cheap and very quick they keep coming back to back ! i’m at 110k a year, single parent renting a two bedroom far af in queens and i have 2k in my bank account and drowning queens with roommates you can’t. living at home with your mom and having a life while living on your current wages…. how much do you have “left” to pay what will be your rent? probably not $1k per month. you’ll need at least that, to have roommates. think about logistics how are you going to move all your things. how much have you saved up for a security deposit and first and last months rent. are you willing to have random roommates that you might hate or live in conditions that you might be uncomfortable (loud neighbors, unsafe neighborhoods). are you willing to live on a strict budget and work another job? if you find a place with cheap rent there is a reason why the place is cheap. coming from experience rn newly moved out 😓 but i make 53k a year. tbh i would live at home for several more years until your salary goes up and keep applying for the housing lottery. also think about commuting costs and the time it takes to commute to your work place. im in nj it takes me $10.50 round trip to go to work and takes me 2hrs round trip to commute. do you have friends also that can move out with you and you guys can rent together? thats what my brother did but the area he lived in is not safe and he was struggling paying rent with two jobs. i knew a chef at trump towers making $17/ hr living in midtown.  not exactly sure how he did it, but maybe his parents supported him. in any case, it’s very impressive and seemed doable. he was a hard worker unless you can find a place on like facebook marketplace for 500 or less not sure how you would make a 18 an hour salary work to live on your own 18/hr is basically minimum wage. maybe you can rent a room. or live with 7 roomates when you say within commuting distance of bryant park, what do you mean? do you mean walking distance? on the subway you’re already commuting distance and you said you’re willing to travel over an hour. you may be able to find rent stabilized apts in upper manhattan / bronx to live on your own or maybe 1 roommate. you should look into north jersey as well. it’s a better quality of life than living in midtown. it is doable on your salary if you keep other expenses in check. rent a room, get public housing, put your name on the affordable housing lotteries. your options are limited on your salary, but if you're not looking to live by your job its doable.  ""within an hour"" is essentially most of nyc, and even some parts of nj if you take the path. i feel for you i really do - i also had to move from my parents home for mental health reasons and finding my own place was hard. i was making like 800-1k a week tho (worked like 80 hours a week) and had good credit. started out by living with 3 other roommates. paid $700 a month in rent living close to prospect park (i probably couldn’t get a situation like that now but it was a rent stabilized apt. had roaches but you know) you probably won’t afford anywhere in manhattan but if you look in the outer boroughs you’ll be able to find something. it might be a sh*hole but for me living in a 💩 🕳️ was better than living with my mom and i was very happy. good luck to you! this should be illegal. stay home and stack it up as long as you can get a second job and stay home to stack your money - you'll be home a lot less and should be able to afford a place within a year or two. the requirements for apartments and even rooms are ridiculous, and if you're not an in abusive situation - tough it out. spend more time doing things you enjoy or can potentially enjoy. home should just be for sleeping, showering and shitting.      i know this isn't the advice that if the most desirable, but as someone who has been laid off for a year - the market is garbage. maybe, just maybe if you find another job, then you'd be able to move out. but i wouldn't move out without a second job first. living alone on $20/hr is crazy. it’s difficult but not impossible to live on your own making $18 an hour. i encourage you to apply for low income housing opportunities on housing connect - there will be something within your income bracket that will make it possible to have your own place. best of luck to you there are some hdfcs in hell’s kitchen and hudson yards.  if those buildings are considering low to moderate income you may qualify for special interest rates and down payment assistance.  you’d still need some cash on hand though.  if your goal is to live in midtown at that budget, i’d look at what hdfcs are available and what the numbers look like.  you may be presently surprised that it is affordable, but it’ll be bare bones and you may not like the block.  in the interim, have you considered trying your get a union job?  long term that may be a better way to grow your pay with quality benefits.  and if you can get into an hdfc in midtown, it sounds like you could create a nice little set up for yourself. tons of nyc jobs will get you more than 18/hr, go get one of them! unless you live with a bunch of roommates it is not likely. it would cost around $3k a month for a studio plus gas, electric, and internet. you need to be making over $100k to live on your own in manhattan these days. change your name, go down to the border and take a free bus to new york. you’ll get, cash, a hotel room. free cell service…😂😂😂 i could rent my cat's bed to you for a couple sq feet are you trying to become more independent and get peace away from family? then finding rooming with compatible roommates can be just what you need. ask anyone about what a difference it made to get out of the parents house and have a roommate or more instead. and you sound like you are just starting out so it usually is the next appropriate step in you situation. just figure out your budget for the month and week by week before you start looking.  i am not sure what you consider commuting distance. just remember sometimes we have to make sacrifices to move ahead.  if you re not having to drive almost an hour or 3 hour public transit then maybe rethink of you can widen your requirements for the location of a new living space. there’s a chipotle by the battery park they pay $21/hour and close at 5 at $18/hr sorry you can’t. it might be worth looking into the housing lottery. you’re not going far with 18/hr. stay home and stack money and experience maybe jersey city would be worth a look on that budget 🤷‍♂️ yeah i sympathize with you i was going to say just stay and save money then i read the rest of the post.  i would look for a place with roommates though should be able to find rent for 500-700 i would think you don't make enough to live on your own or even with a roommate... focus on making more, you are currently priced out. you don’t. you cant man i'm from the d.c. area, so... this doesn't matter to nyc i guess.  but coming from an expensive place i'll say this:  those of us from here who can make the money, do. those of us who can't, like me, leave.  but i came back when i got section 8. if you can't stay at home, it might be time to leave new york. you can’t. move. expeditiously no you cant live in nyc on that wage, not even close live in a box it’s all about saving money before you strike out on your own….im originally from texas, went to school at the university of houston….i lived at home and saved up out of college. after two years i bought my first house…just a 1500 sf starter…..couple of years later i bought another house and used it as a rental. i bought two more homes with the money i made….so at 32 i owned 4 homes.( grandfather guided me through this process). at 36-37 i cashed in…..the market was perfect for sellers ( in texas at least). i always wanted to live in nyc….sold all four homes and three of them i got over the asking price. i made just shy of 500k when i moved. i moved to nyc in 2009 which turned out to be a great time to buy! i actually got a place i could afford easily on broadway between central park and the hudson….love new york! what about washington heights makes you think you don’t already live in nyc?

108,A Saga: We signed a lease for the 1st of the month. Current tenants have asked us if they could stay longer...,"i think you shouldn't have done this. it's their problem. why aren’t you dealing with the landlord? that’s who’s suppose to clean and deal with this crap. not you can i rent the apartment for a tuesday in october for a day? i’ll zelle you i promise why are you at a bar two days before move-out? i’d be packing/cleaning my ass off! you went wrong by getting involved, especially this involved.   this should have between the current tenants and the landlord to figure out. landlord should have told them no and the apartment was already re-rented, or could have come to you themselves to see about working it out. what if you can’t stay in your current apt another 2 days, then it’s the same thing on your end, etc?  nice of you to try to figure out a compromise, but who knows how it’s going to play out… good luck! you should not have negotiated them to begin with. i commend you for doing it. sorry people are pieces of shit. if the world was a better place, this would’ve been an awesome gesture and everyone wins. now they hate you for doing something most wouldn’t & you stressed over the whole situation. this could’ve went so smoothly and they decided to botch it no chance i would have ever done this.  well, not for 2x rent. maybe 10x. despite the added stress, you probably made out ahead because of your negotiations.  if the previous tenants had wanted to, they could have stayed those 2 extra days and you wouldn’t have been able to do anything about it. the only thing the landlord could do is start an eviction proceeding, which would be moot as soon as they move out. he could then sue them for damages, but that’s even more time and you wouldn’t see that money.  you wouldn’t have gotten the unit on the 1st and the only thing you could do is cancel your lease for failure to get access on the first day of the lease. you could get your money back, but would be back to square 1 on your apartment search.  not legal advice - just my opinion on the situation bad move on your part they can rent a hotel and put stuff in storage seems like the landlord should’ve told them the date and if they weren’t out they would accrue extra charges along with their deposit since it wasn’t cleaned. moving is stressful enough. i wouldn’t want to be involved with the prior tenants procrastination. something tells me you’re going to be posting another saga in a few days given how this interaction has gone thus far in two days-prior tenant won't vacate, what are my options? i'm only hoping you don't end up paying rent for squatters from this point forward 😬. you chose a battle that wasnt even your brah... but you live and you learne (i hope) good luck. i would not recommend trying that again. you went wrong by getting involved at all. this is entirely the landlords problem. this was super naive. you do not owe the old tenants anything and really made a mistake here no good deed goes unpunished.  i can see you were just trying to be reasonable and helpful and stuff, but this wasn't very smart.  for a landlord, having a tenant move out at the end of their lease without damaging the property, as opposed to trashing the place on the way out, or staying without paying rent and requiring eviction (which takes months) are pretty much the biggest risks and ways to lose tens of thousands of dollars.  now, those risks become your problem, in exchange for $564.  a better way would be to have just said no.  if you really wanted to accommodate them... then tell them they can extend the lease with the landlord for two days, you will push back your own move-in date for your own lease by two days, they pay your enough money to make the hassle worth your while (in the thousands), and avoid any period where they have possession during your lease. that way, if they don't move out/trash the place, it's the landlords problem to evict and not yours, and you just don't start your lease. you were more than fair.    now the worry is you're gonna have to clench your cheeks and hope   1) they actually leave day of 2) they don't fuck something up out of spite    i suggest if #1 happens, you take a full video of that place. there's no way they won't do something out of spite. i know this type. they are dogshit people. if your lease starts on august 1st then why are you entitled to u&o for july 31st? i wouldve said 2x or nothing, welcome to ny. you can pay or get fucked how did they even get your contact info? all this drama for $600 you have to split between 3 people haha? should have told them to figure it out with the landlord you acted as an adult and learned something. they didn't. enjoy your new apartment. my goodness what a nightmare!!! i think you made a mistake.  hopefully they get out.  i’m weary of these types of situations, my family had a really bad set of squatters in their rental that basically destroyed my parents financially.  if someone starts showing you a tip of their red flag, run. almost any landlord i’ve dealt with over the years will let you move in a day or two early as long as monies are paid and lease is signed. 99% of the time the apartment is vacant by then and they understand not every 31/1st fall on a weekend when most people try to move. they can put their stuff in storage for a few days. there's other reasons for not allowing this too. as the lease holder you're responsible for damage to the apartment. if they damage it on their lease it's on them. if they damage it moving out on your lease it's on you.  sometimes being nice is not as smart as simply following the rules. ugh, i moved into a room in an apartment. i overlapped with my existing apartment by a month just so i could move in slowly and not be stressed. the person i was replacing had lost their job, which is how they had their visa, and had to leave suddenly. i was sympathetic to them and let them stay a couple of days (for free!) because they were uprooting their life and moving internationally completely unexpectedly. however, they would not leave. this started me off on such a bad foot with the new roommate (she defended him even when it was two weeks and i had movers booked and and had been telling him he needed his furniture out of the room by a certain date), that i ended up only living in that place for two months.  i would never offer someone that kindness again without landlord/real estate agent involvement. well did they move out? i need to know if they actually moved out on the date agreed! i do not know why you or your roommate entertained this or got involved to the point where you guys were trying to draft legal documents. how did she even get your number? stop trying to be a good person by letting others fuck you over. you should have told her to talk to the landlord not you from the get go. same day move-out/mive-in crossover happens all the time in rentals. just because because the scheduled a move out on july 30 instead of the 31st or aug 1, the former tenants still legally have pression of the apartment until 11:59.59pm on the 31st. now obviously move-outs aren't going to happen or even be allowed at midnight so it's pretty much standard that the prior tenants move out in the am and the new tenant moves-in in the pm. the former tenant will be moving there stuff directly to their new apartment that likely had a former tenant moving out that morning too. it's a vicious cycle. i'm surprised you got them to agree to pay anything and they couldn't go through the ll. the apartment on the 30th/31st wasn't yours yet so you can't aim compensation.   as for the cleanliness, the only contracted responsibility upon vacating is leaving the apartment broom swept. i know in that short turnover time that might seem wrong but it's the way it is. just make sure you do a thorough inspection with the ll, super, or their agent who will be transferring the keys to you day of for any existing damage or nonfunctional or malfunctioning appliances, electrical, etc. so you can have it taken care if asap.  sorry you're going through this but it  really is quite normal. i've always worked with people during moves because it always like this when you move and gone through the landlord over extra day issues. this is because a) i want to transfer the apartment with my landlord and an inspection, so damages are assigned to the correct people. b) the landlord did the clean between tenants before i moved in.  any good landlord i've had, prorated my lease and collected the extra money from the tenant themselves. the best landlords didn't charge the extra days and pro-rated my lease anyway to show they were good faith. this generally gave me a chance to establish a relationship where i had helped the landlord out and when things went bad, that helped me in my dealings with the landlord.  i've lived in nyc for 20 years. i do not think everyone is out to scam you. i don't think the comic is out to scam you. she probably expected you be more like a normal new yorker and not treat her like an enemy since this is a situation you will eventually be in yourself.   generally speaking, don't be a dick. most people don't do anything like this and generally try to stay chill and put their best face forward to the new landlord. your new ll will hear about this from the comic and they will likely adjust how they handle themselves. i find when you get litigious, you'll get what you are owed and no more, which can often be less what a good landlord does for other people. nice going dumbass you sound like an asshole (just some of the phrasing you used). and the old tenants sound like idiots.   the landlord should have handled this or not done this at all. fyi.  in new york when you sign a lease you have until noon the next day to get out.  is if you lease end 7/31 you must vacate by 8/1 at noon.   that is how everyone works it out.",170,94,negative,0.7335987091064453,264,"they you just move out. you just move out. you just move out. if #2 happens, you're gonna have to clench your cheeks and hope they actually leave day of. i'm sorry people are pieces of shit. i think you went wrong by getting involved. this is entirely the landlords problem. i think you should have just said no. i think you should have just said no. i"
109,Do NOT rent with June Homes under any circumstances.,"i hated my experience with june homes. my unit’s shower was broken and they kept saying that repairs were the property owner’s responsibility and that they were “trying” to get in touch. when the plumber came after two weeks of yellow sludge coming out of the pipes and my roommates and i having to shower at the gym, he told us that june homes lied to the property owner about taking care of repairs.   then we had a fly infestation. in december. they were coming in from everywhere and we set up fly paper traps from the ceiling that started to collapse under their weight. when we reached out to try to get an exterminator to figure out what was going on they tried to make it our problem implying that maybe we had left food out and that we should just buy bug spray. this went on for an entire week until they finally sent someone over and the guy couldn’t figure out where the flies were coming from and suggested that maybe something was rotting at a different place in the building.   and then one night i got locked out of the building. i tried calling the emergency line and they said that if i wanted the code to the lockbox with the backup key they’d have to charge me. and since it was freezing i agreed and when i opened the lockbox it was empty. only then did they decide that the fee was unnecessary.   june homes is a trap. not surprised aya (aka helloaya) is a similar company, also a scam. be careful those companies pays listing ones like roomi to be listed as “partner” to gain your trust.   then they add hidden charges, they let you in the sh*tiest place, it works if you have no maintenance but as soon as you need anything: they will make you understand the terrible mistake you made. thank you everyone for your critical warningssssss! this company has been on my radar for days oh man, my time to tell my story about june homes and i hope everyone avoids them at all costs no matter how tempting they make it seem. i think they prey on first time renters in the city or people who need an apartment fast.  with this being said, half of this story is on june homes, and the other half being on my old super/landlord.   i signed a lease with june homes in 2022. i was moving from the south to be in the city with my now wife. after numerous failed attempts with brokers and issues knowing what was legit from being so far away, i went with june homes.   i paid for an early move in ($50 for 10:30 compared to 3:30). i had drove over two days in a small u-haul and was just ready to get unpacked. we get there and none of the codes work on the 10 lockboxes outside. so then i had to call management which turned into a disaster in itself. finally a guy shows up almost an hour later while i have a u-haul on a small 1 way street.   then the door lock is dead when he finally gets us in the front door. and of course this isn’t a door lock that takes a key or an external battery. so now he spends the next two hours breaking into our apartment.   when he finally gets the door open (1:30) the apartment is full of furniture, coffee maker, cups, plates, you name it. it’s furnished, which was not on my lease. so now we have no where to put our stuff.   the u-haul at this time has already received two tickets and we have no where to move into. we slammed all of their stuff into the bedroom, and put all of our stuff literally to the ceiling in the living room. now we can’t unpack until they get their stuff and we can barely even move in this apartment.   i’m not exaggerating.. i spent almost a month trying to get them to pick up their stuff. they got the furniture after two weeks but there were still all kinds of other stuff. after day after day of no response i just set the stuff out in the curb. june homes never even cared to follow up.   next comes the double utility bills. double electricity, double heat, double gas, it was always messed up month after month. they only let you use utilities through their app and it’s a mess in itself. i got charged for months of utilities even after my lease ended and had to fight every month that i don’t owe this bill.   next comes the water leak. this situation is likely on my super/landlord but it was made way worse by june homes incompetence. their customer service is the worst/ doesn’t follow up/ gets passed on to the next person who has no idea what’s going on. long story short there was a pipe burst up stairs in the unit down the hall right around christmas. we woke up to airbnb guests in the hall yelling and water just gushing. well guess what, that water ran through the ceiling and created a leak, a water bubble, and an electrical box filled with water that was still active (i got shocked when assessing how bad the problem was). the actual leak and water bubble was over the apartment breaker box.  i sent countless photos, requests, videos, phone calls, and it never got fixed. we lived with that leak from christmas until august.   there’s more issues, and this isn’t even the worst. stay away from june homes. cannot express enough how much i loathe june homes. conversely, i've had two good experiences with helloaya which coliving businesses are actually half decent? i have been looking into a few. thanks for this because their listings are everywhere!! i seriously considered renting from them and a reddit post similar to this stopped me. i hope others see this and avoid them. honestly, i think a lot of these cohabiting places sound sketch, which is unfortunate. i remember looking at a few i found on spare room...hard pass. better off finding a roommate on your own. i can verify, alway get scammy replies. the roommate thing is the same for regular apartments too… like if a roommate leaves, you’re responsible for the rent. if you reject the roommate that has every right to lease the apartment, and they can’t fill the room, you should be responsible for the rent.   btw saying this as someone who has rented from june homes twice, with roommates in both apartments, and had a great experience.",170,21,negative,0.7180334329605103,191,i was charged for months of utilities. i had to fight every month that i don’t owe this bill. i got charged for months of utilities even after my lease ended. i was charged for months of utilities. i was charged for months of utilities. i was charged for months of utilities. i was charged for months of utilities. i was charged for months of utilities. i was charged for months of utilities. i
110,Do not move into an apartment like this! ,"any idea the addresses of his properties? thank you for posting, this is certainly allowed had the same issue, my con ed bill has been around 500 a month from electric heating and the water boiler. i will never rent an apartment with electric heat again! did the lease specify that the cost of hot water would be included in the rent? oh god… i just signed a lease for an apartment like this and am now terrified of my con ed bills. listen landlords are generally shitty humans, but coned did hike prices like 15%+ this past year. so i guess fuck em both this sucks but i also live on the ues (in a top floor walkup) with electric heating and was given a month free in order to help pay for the heating. so far we’ve lucked out and it’s been around $30 a month (3 bed apt). maybe your insulation was really bad? curious if this is going to be the case for most new properties since they can’t add gas to new construction anymore.  electric heat can be quite costly, my friends mom bought an apartment in a new building in long beach, and the entire building is electric only and my friend has to help her mom with bills because the utilities run so much higher than her building in brooklyn did bc it was on gas. okay, so avoid electric heat?  and call coned and inquire about average bills for previous tenants?  is that the net takeaway here? lol that’s literally been my bill since november. electric heaters suck. it’s like having a car payment. did you pursue legal action? hi op, i’m so sorry you went through this! i also live in a fred mengoni property and i was just curious how you got in touch with the management? in my building no one is in the office except the super on occasion and i was never provided with contact info when i moved in, my realtor gave me all the wrong info for a different building and i never heard back from him when i reached out for the right info. i’ve been here for 3 years and my only correspondence with management has been me sliding my lease renewal under the office door and then my super delivers it. i’m trying to move out and i don’t know how to give my notice! (any tips would be appreciated!) i’ll play devils advocate.  i live in a studio in a fm building. rent is well below market rate on the ues and it is well maintained.  in building washer/dryer that is fixed promptly when broken. always clean & well maintained common areas. elevator. monthly exterminator. never once had a rat. once had a cockroach in two years. i can barely hear my neighbors ever. units are well maintained but not updated. my studio is pretty small (350-400sq ft). the units get the job done.  many of my neighbors are older individuals who seem to be in a rent stabilized situation here. my rent has only increased 3% yoy. something with the title of the management company moving they don’t raise rent a lot?? idk, they haven’t screwed me yet.   i’ve seen the same neighbors consistently for 3 years now. many people stay. some go. mix of young professionals & retirees with a small sprinkle of families. maybe 3 or 4 total.  electric heating and water heating does run up a tab. most of what i’ve seen is actually the coned spike in cost. 30% of my bill is the actual electric used, 70% is delivery charges. my studio runs about avg $120 a month. which is high but once i consider it’s “everything” (electric, heat, water, garbage, etc) it makes it easier to swallow.  my total monthly bills for everything (rent,utilities, internet) usually runs $2100-2200.  i will say that i do grind to keep the electric bill low in the winter. wall heater set to (60-65) and use space heaters when needed, dress warm and better bedding. thinking soon im going to get blackout curtain & magnetic insulation kit to help with the windows. also, i covered the ac unit with an ac cover(?) that prevents cold air from leeking in in the winter.  i have seen new water heaters and ac being installed to the units that are being flipped.   getting a $500-$700 is quite intense but i can assume 70% of that is the delivery charge. that seems ridiculously high. however, if you have a 2br and the monthly rent is 3k; it evens out. were you able to control your heat? turn on/off or temperature settings? [deleted] it is very common to have to pay for heat or hot water. my last apartment and current apartment both have gas heating/hot water, and i am billed by national grid based on how much i used. but my monthly bill has always been between $50-$110 and i have 2 floors.  your problem isn’t paying for hot water or heat, your landlord might have done something shady with your meter.   to clarify, the “hot” part of the hot water is what i pay for, the water itself is covered and i pay for the gas to heat it up if that make sense. his the electric heat sufficient in winter? if it's still below legal minimums you have a habitability case. i would buy a thermometer for each room and take written/photo recordings. them sue for your con ed bills and possibly even damages if the cold is an issue [deleted] all electric apartments are miserable. i used to live in one and my monthly bill would come to around 800 bucks.",169,86,negative,0.8451438546180725,255,i’ve seen new units being built and the ac units being flipped.’s what i get. i’ve seen new units being built and the ac units being flipped. is the problem. is what i get. i’ve seen new units being built. i’ve seen new units being built. is what i get.??....

115,Boyfriend Broke up with me right after we renewed the lease,"find a roommate listing projects, nyc.sublets on insta, leasebreak, your neighborhood fb group… even aribnb if allowed. post it everywhere and i’m sure you’ll find someone in due time! so sorry to hear he’s not being helpful throughout this painful process ❤️‍🩹 talk to the landlord and be upfront that your circumstances have changed. offer to pay rent until they find a replacement tenant or offer to sublease instead. up to you how much to emphasize the you can't afford part, but that's a measure to incentive your landlord to work with you because the alternative is a lengthy eviction process that they do not want.    try and claim you can't afford a termination fee outside of losing your security deposit too, since eviction hurts them more.  but those are my thoughts.  start looking for an apt asap though, affordable stuff is drying up fast it seems   you're only real negotiating lever is that you can force them to evict you instead and that you won't have much assets for them to go after. think about how to word that nicely without being threatenijg unless your place is a real dump, you could probably find someone to take it over by sept. the month of august might be hard financially but at least you'd be out.   start posting in housing groups here and on fb with photos and details. i think the only option here (if you can’t find someone to take over the lease) is to try and negotiate a lower lease break fee. been there. i think you're best off exerting all your options.  i would treat finding someone to take over the lease like a full time job. even if you can't find someone to take over the lease i would start subletting month to month just so you have the supplemental income. at the same time, i would look for cheaper accommodation, even temporary, just so you have somewhere to live once you find a replacement tenant. this is priority #1.  you probably can't avoid eating some costs, here. much better to have smaller monthly costs than one big 15k one. interested in taking over lease. send info? can you make it a flex and get a roommate? also advertise on craigslist.  demand is greater than supply so you should be able to find someone. i'm not sure what the fee is, but you can list lease takeovers on the listings project (https://www.listingsproject.com/). this happened to me two years ago literally the same thing. lived together for a year and one month after re signing he broke up with me. i moved out and he took over the lease. honestly i just made him feel guilty and it worked. to be honest, if you could somehow swing the money it is worth it to get out of that situation. if you have a 401k i know it’s not ideal but you can withdraw from it for hardship like this.   btw it gets so much better- it’s been 2 years and i’m engaged with the love of my life! so sorry you are going through this. bf makes 3x and makes you pay half? fuck this guy https://preview.redd.it/pvjb1vqfaddd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c593a28495b632f9cce4af8c3b20ec6661faa8fd  please look up changes in nys rent laws my advice is to call his bluff. tell him that you cant afford any money for fees and you arent paying. the breakup was his idea so he can deal with it or it can go into default. otherwise you will keep living there and paying your half.   theres other things you could do. sublet shouldn’t incur fees.  but seriously call a lawyer, there are free/subsidized ones bc though the city that do consultations  (tenants rights). good luck. you have threeish options.    1. pay the lease break   2. surrender the apartment. then hope they find someone fast who will pay the same as you. you'd be responsible for rent until they find someone and the difference if they can't get same rate.  3. you find someone yourself to transfer lease or sublet if the lease allows   what's right or wrong is probably for a different sub. whoever is on the lease is reasonable to pay i’m sorry this happened :( i hope you’re able to come up with a solution.   also, i know it sucks right now but it sounds like this guy is a huge asshole if he’s putting you in this position and refusing to accept responsibility, so it will be a good thing in the long run that you’re getting away from such a pos. lol let him know that he wanted to break up and he can be responsible for the lease break fee. still look for coverage but not sure why you won't call his bluff. his name is on the lease do. a default will hurt him as well put this on leasebreak.com right away and offer some incentive like 2 weeks free or whatever (maybe someone can advise what). i took over a leasebreak.com apartment for the opposite reason - someone wanted to move in with their partner - and it worked out well for everyone. it sounds like a great apartment - someone will want it at the right price. the landlord has a duty to mitigate now so i would use that to try and negotiate a one month fee. most places don’t stay vacant that long. r/circlejerknyc i’m a licensed real estate agent in manhattan. if you have questions about how this seriously works, and need true legitimate advice from a professional, please send me a message. more than willing to help. in nyc tenant can break lease at anytime have you guys contemplated “splitting up together”ing the situation? you know one week you ride the couch and one week he rides the couch. you can do this until you can find someone. talk to an an attorney who specializes in this, i have seen links posted for legal aid etc. verify what the ll can and can't do. see if you can get out of it.  the lease hasn't started so move fast. hi where is the location? how many bedrooms? maybe i can get it say you lost your job can’t afford it anymore see what landlord can do for you and they will be quicker to find replacement list it on streeteasy were you guys splitting rent halfway? your landlord should offer an option for you to be put on “tenant paying” status where they put the apartment on the market and make efforts to get it re-rented. once a new lease has been signed, you should be issued a cancellation rider. i work in property management and this is how we handle all of our inquiries about lease breaks. apartment needs to be vacated 1 week before the new tenant moves in (so the apartment can be cleaned and repainted) and payment is due up until the day before the new lease begins. while it’s hard to know when the apartment might rent, now is peak season for nyc moving/rentals, so there’s a good chance they’ll find someone if they make efforts to market it. of course it’d be ideal to just let you out of the lease, penalty-free, but… it’s nyc real estate so :/ @lonley_ad4006 please read their comment please look up changes in nys rent laws “if you leave your apartment or other rental home before your lease ends, your landlord has to make a good-faith effort to fill the vacancy. if the landlord finds a new tenant, and the new tenant’s rent is equal or higher to your rent, your lease is considered terminated and you are no longer liable for the rent.”  https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2019-changesinnyrentlaw.pdf  met council tenant hotline can verify for you too and or help you. more importantly…why did you guys break up try signing up to listingsproject & post it there. might get some bites. are you a taurus? if so, we can date for 2 weeks then i’ll ask to move in with you the landlord does not care who is right they just what their money. you can move out and leave him behind when he is at work. this way you can find a new place while there no lawsuit on your history.  if the landlord sues both of you since he makes more he may end up paying most of it anyway since its easier to collect from him.   send landlord a  certfied us mail letter that you have moved out and that bf has remained so they cannot bill the full year. the lease governs the situation. if you can flex into a two bedroom, that's your best option and get a roommate. i'm sorry. good luck. lol so your rent is nearly 5k a month? break the lease and go into a regular 1 bedroom apartment for 1800 take him to small claims. call his bluff and say you can’t afford it, you’re not paying for it and if he wants to be locked in for a year he can continue to pay while you live th ere otherwise he can pay for the lease break. it’s not on you to have foresight for his issues. sorry bye to this man do they have a smaller bedroom apartment you or he can move into? sometimes, they will allow that if they get a lease out of it. can either of you afford the rent on your own? find someone to take over the lease on fb marketplace, listingsprojectd and most on social media.   i had someone take over my  lease a year ago when i wanted to move out of my apartment post breakup. although i could afford the place on my own i was too traumatized to be in that place + a better apartment situation came up.   i met her through fb marketplace, did a decent background check, asked her to provide her proof or work/employment, 1 year housing reference and credit check. when it comes to being sued, some lawyers might suggest you liquidate your assets to prevent them from being taken from you. liquidate and make it look like you spent it all on a vacation- or actually spend it on finding a new apartment.  if someone is suing you all they can see is what’s in your account. you don’t really need to do this until you have an idea that the lawsuit really will happen. you can also sue your ex for breach of contract. lease break fees are illegal.  find me @brokeringbrooklyn on instagram and maybe i can help. entire nyc is insane with prices ether try to get on hud or section 8 i know it sucks but this is nyc you don’t move unless you know you got it and yes i know section eight takes years sorry this happened this guy sounds like a shit. but also how did he avoid being on the lease if he makes all the money? like for you to be approved you have to make like 40x the rent right? i'm in this exact situation down to the 2.5 years thing, literally so crazy. i'm not in ny but i've just decided to ignore him and keep being roommates until i can find a subleaser... so sorry to you. you’ll probably need a lawyer here.  based on the other comments, it’s a niche/expensive apartment, and 25% of the contract price seems fair to break it.  if you really are broke, and he isn’t. you can probably stop paying until they sue, then attempt to settle for way less.  don’t bring him in, just wait till they sue you then ask to be released from the suit for like 3k. they’ll go after him for the rest since he makes more anyways. should’ve thought that through before putting your name on a lease you couldn’t afford. he was definitely paying the majority of your rent before, and now he’s gone. oopsie!   break the lease and find a unit you can afford on your own income. sorry to hear that, but interestingly i’ve seen similar cases and most men who make 6 figures don’t pay that much. i’m a man and i don’t understand, if i break up i’ll stand with her until things get better (unless she did me bad). hang on, questions:  1) he makes 3x, so can he afford this place on his own?  2) what was his plan after breaking up? does he want to move out also or stay?   3) it’s a 1bdrm but is there another room just bdrm bathroom living room kitchen i think your landlord will be happy if you leave, he can rent it for a much higher price. just tell them that you are moving and thats it. [deleted] ok everyone has given you great advice here so i’ll just throw a hare brained scheme out there. illegally airbnb it, and just in general be the worst tenant ever, and have the landlord begging you to move out! but in all seriousness a lot of people are looking for a place rn i think your best bet is to act like the realtor to your place and put ads out and show people the place until you find someone. saving 15k will be worth it. good luck! i could recommend a broker specializing in lease breaks! i could connect you with them and they can consult with you on what options are availed to you. feel free to dm me :) sue your boyfriend in small claims court. his name is on the lease so hes legally responsible for half. its going to affect him more later on. you’re a woman so you got that on your side. wont be hard to find another boyfriend and move in with him you’ll be okay. nyc has a lot of rules many of which people hardly follow. hang in there you saved yourself a massive headache in the future if you had kids with him. like a bronx tale, “you got off cheap” there is a perfectly valid argument that you are willing to live up to the lease and pay your half of the rent. he's the one who is backing out so he should pay his share. [deleted] let me treat u right and i got $ for rent ur ex a bum lol this is just an echo chamber for broke vindictive girls. who hurt yall? as they say: can’t put a ring on a 304 stop doing husband things with a boyfriend! someone should have told him it is cheaper to keep her!! how is 2.5 years long term? lol",159,177,neutral,0.5057976245880127,336,find a roommate and post it everywhere. you find a solution soon. you get some relief soon. you get some relief soon. i’m so sorry to hear this. i’m engaged and it’s been 2 years and i’m so happy! i’m so sorry this happened. i’m so sorry. i’m sorry. i hope you get some relief soon. you find someone!
116,I built a community app for NYC rentals! Add the apartment you're moving out of to see other people's apartments before they hit the market,"hey all, more info here - i had posted a google form here a month ago where people could list their spots and in exchange they’d get access to a google sheet with all of the spots people had listed. i got the idea after i got to talking with some people while in line for an open house and realized my spot might be a good fit for them even though it wasn't for me. the response was great and in just a month we had over 160 listings that were not yet on the market. but honestly keeping the sheet updated got old pretty quick and it wasn’t ideal in the first place since everyone’s email became public and there were no photos of the listings. i love building things so i figured i’d make this an app for everyone to use. you can download leaseswap nyc today for free on ios. the app is completely free to use and i hope it’s a good resource for people to find rentals in the mess that is the nyc real estate market.  some of the ways an app is better than a google sheet:  **-** photos: browse through photos of the available listings.  **-** report listings: help us keep the community safe by reporting any suspicious listings.  **-** favorites: save your favorite listings for easy access.  **-** verified listings: everyone's phone number is verified, and i'm looking for more ways to verify listings  **-** privacy: your phone number and email are kept private and not shared with anyone else.  i would love to hear any feedback on how i could make this better for everyone - let me know what yall think! finally. we’ve been needing this loveeee this idea. nyc rental market is brutal 😅 i can’t really use it because i don’t have a place to offer but the app looks really slick from what i can see! well done!   is the eventual plan to offer a paid subscription for folks who are looking for places but don’t have a fee-free listing to offer up in exchange? do you publicize the unit number on each listing? mostly concerned about privacy/security seeing as there’s pics. i’m not actively moving out but was curious to just browse would love to pay for access to this as i’m not in the city but have been dying to move for 2+ years and especially the past 6 months. it’s just so expensive with fees. i’d love to help in any capacity i can, especially from a reporting (bi) standpoint well done, solid idea. congrats on the launch! unsolicited feedback:  - editing a posting is kind of annoying because i have to redo the entire “add listing” flow, and some of my selections aren’t remembered (one is the “is this rent-stabilized?” question. i would expect a consolidated experience, perhaps more similar in ui/ux to how the listing looks when posted.  - i think the “post a listing, view the listings” is valid growth idea! should help you build up the supply side if you keep with it. monetizing for non-posting users for access is valid as well (when the supply gets bigger).  - perhaps notification options for new postings. i’m not in ny anymore but i think this is a fantastic idea. [deleted] does this app work if i don’t currently have an apt in the city? does you need landlord’s approval or is it done as a sublease? [deleted] interested in this app! tried listing my place but couldn’t add a second photo so i couldn’t post the listing. the “+” button didn’t work. just a heads up! i built an app for food in nyc and got banned by mods but this thing just flourishes wow mods here are nice i think this sounds great! i will need to avail of this in the fall. please do let us know when an android or website version of this app is ready, as i don't have an iphone! thanks! help me understand how this works.  so people  posti an upcoming available apartment because they happen to be moving out of it? how long before they move out are they posting? and who is benefiit from the post and how? you do realize that if you have already told your ll you're vacating, they've already blasted every agent and brokerage that subscribes to their blasts that an apartment is soon to be available.  there are 10s of 1000s of rental apartments in the city and in general they don't even need to be ""listed"" you would be in essence advertising for your ll for free, you're not getting anything out of it and an incoming potential tenant is going to be subject to the same process to apply for and get the apartment regardless of where they saw the initial post. there's no leg up or getting to the front of the line. unless the ll is a diy mom and pop shop, they would be represented and no matter where an inquiry comes from, it still has to go through their broker. i appreciate and applaud your trying to buck the system, but the reality is what you're doing is the exact thing that every ll's real estate agent/broker or management co is already doing. for real, what are you getting out of it and who is this.supposed.to help? to be clear, if your ll has a management co or broker that reps.them, and their apartments are not an open listings, it wouldn't even be legal for you or anyone else  to post the apartment anywhere without your ll's permission. you better do your due diligence or you're going to open yourself up to lawsuits.  fyi this is very similar to how a certain service that rhymes with fleet sleazy started....and in ny real estate, it's supremely complicated. there are a lot of rules and  laws that have to be followed and it takes a license in order to do the deals and even advertise.",157,73,positive,0.7332416772842407,230,"? and who is no ads, no blasted blasts, no blasted blasts. you're blasted by your landlord. you're blasted by your landlord. you're blasted by your landlord. you're blasted by your landlord. you're blasted by your landlord. you're blasted. you're blasted. you get paid. but you get nothing. and you get"
117,Did i get a good deal on this apartment ? ,"imo a lot of the value of an apartment comes from how close it is to where you need to be. so if you spend all of your time in kew gardens, then ya? seems high for that area honestly depends. is there elevator or laundry? if not, then, not really. kew gardens is pretty deep. i will say securing an rs place without a broker fee is great luck, though. there’s so much more to take into consideration. for example: floor, elevator, laundry, neighbors 2400 seems on the high end for kew gardens but it looks lovely ! i’m in rego park and pay 2100 for a 1br. why are you asking this question after signing the lease? taxed for kew gardens but you didn’t pay a fee so it all works out looks huge fwiw i used to live in kew gardens and it’s a lovely neighborhood! i miss it so much! you have trains that take you right to manhattan pretty quickly and the bus takes you right to the mall. comparison is the thief of joy. the grass is always greener when it comes to nyc apartments- someone always has something cheaper, bigger, or in a nicer location than you. you survived the gauntlet that is nyc apartment hunting and got a rent-stabilized apartment! not too shabby!  not sure how it works for 1st floor apartments, but landlords need to install window guards for children under a certain age (which you will soon have). not the deal of the century, just olay not really imo, especially being first floor and no laundry. kew gardens is a more middle-ish area for rent in queens so that's kinda high. at least it's big and rent stabilized though, so if you stay for a while it'll eventually become a good deal? jeepers! this is expensive for kew gardens but if it makes you happy then that’s all that really matters. i’ve come to learn that people prioritize different things when it comes to their living situation in this city. your apartment has to be your sanctuary. i lived in kew gardens from 2018-2020, paid 1595 for a large 1br1b i’ve lived in kew gardens for 2 years 2020-2022, 1br1b $1800, i miss it a lot, there was a 7-11 across the street and the train is right there, you can also jump on the bus to get to the subway if you don’t want to walk, great neighborhood. also miss having a huge 24 hour laundry in the basement the no laundry in building would be a no-go for me even if it was cheaper, but for 2400? hell no. i have laundry in my building and pay 1900. but i live in another borough so idk if this is standard over there. dishwasher is the best thing here. wait you signed a lease for a 1 bed room and you have a baby on the way ? it might be on the high end  for a 1 bedroom, but it looks like you'd be able to divide the living room and either create a sleeping area for the baby or for you and partner, allowing you to stay there awhile as a family.  ikea cubes with stuff in them make great functional room dividers! and who knows, if you are good tenants and two bedroom opens up, maybe you can get a deal!  living near the lirr will get you to manhattan super quickly, and if you aren't too far from the lirr, you probably aren't too long a walk to the subway which gives you other options.  while queens isn't brooklyn, nearby forest hills offers lots of dining, and entertainment, and you aren't far from jackson heights or astoria which are definately worth visiting. so it doesn't sound like a bad deal. but if there are no washingmachines in your building, definately find out where the neighbors go as that is going to be an issue, and if the lease doesn't prohibit washing machines, look into getting one -- even the kind you have to hook up into your bathtub. queens gets a bad rap generally, but honestly, nothing wrong with it. it's diverse and fascinating. do you like the neighborhood no matter how many times i read posts like this, i still have a hard time wrapping my head around $2,400 for a 1br lol this looks a lottt like my old apartment. i lived there from 2018-2020 2bd 1800 i could never understand how people would rent an apartment that doesn't have room for a living room and kitchen paying the same price with 2br 1 bath and underground parking..behind the courthouse no 1 bedroom apt is worth over 2000 dollars trash , flushing 1750 1 junior 4 apt (with balcony) bigger bed room, living room is huge. kitchen is monster, with 2 year lease minimum and 1 deposit with parking lot. pretty high for that area, also considering that it’s on the first floor. if that heater won’t sing loudly at midnight. i say that based on my experience in nyc. i currently pay 2400 for 1br in kew gardens. i think you'll love the neighborhood, it's very quiet and clean and has good accessibility. close to highways if you drive (i work on li) and 20 mins to manhattan on the lirr, 40 mins on the subway. i like to take walks in forest park, and forest hills gardens. welcome to kew gardens and i hope you enjoy your new home not a good deal, sorry buddy. i found a first floor 1 bdr apartment in clinton hill for 2500. it’s big but after a certain size amenities like modern appliances and laundry become important. nope! not bad! got ripped off, that stripper pole is clearly not in the middle of the room and not usable.  youll never get your money back hosting ""parties"" not even close 2400 in kew gardens? this is the end of times. if it's rent stabilized and you like it, never ever move. they have to renew your lease forever, they can't raise it by more than a certain amount, and it's basically impossible to kick you out. and you can actually leave it to your family if you ever do want to leave, and they get the same deal you have. it's amazing! yeah it’s good. plus i forget what that pizza place is over the hill on lefferts, but the slices are huge!!! from my experience no brokers fee in nyc is always good lol it just all really depends on how close you are to public transit, trains firstly. in this city, it's probably worth more to be able to cut down on your commute than compare square footages. for me, i pay $1580 (rent stabilized) for a 680 sq ft alcove studio with a sunken living room... all of those specs mean nothing when compared to my 30 second walk to my train that gets me to work in 12 minutes, the beach in 15 minutes, and the city in 20. a deal is about how it relates to you and your life.   kew gardens is fantastic, btw. i grew up in woodside and i'd kill to be back in queens, but got priced out after a dhcr landlord petition to destabilize the entire building i lived in my entire life... uprooted all of us in favor of gut renovating and split-leasing the apartments. if you signed a rent stabilized lease in kew gardens, stay there as. long. as. you. can. you got fleeced brother that’s pricy for that area and that size go get welfare to pay for it. get ebt and cash assistance they will accept you. keep your money in crypto. see if you can get a loan to pay off rent and you should be good. you don’t need a car in the city and you don’t need to spend money on these luxury designer clothes. have 2 different banks so you can build “credit score”. it’s not a good deal people don’t pay rent in new york lmfao no you live in nyc and are paying more than double what i pay to live literally 20 minutes from the city. and i have 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. i’ll never understand why people need to live in the city. you’re saving 0 dollars and getting no property out of it. you can literally afford a mortgage with that rent doorman elevator? yes. walk up. no no i would have asked for a little discount because the stripper pole in the kitchen is too close to the wall. it’s not a good deal but you didn’t get ripped off or anything either. first floor, no laundry, so it’s not exactly a catch, size is about in-line with rs apts in elmhurst/rego/forest hills. $2-2.4k with laundry, floor 3+, in building garage, less than 3 blocks from a train station is what i would be looking for in those neighborhoods. looks nice, price isn’t insane for these days. congrats and good luck with the baby! i grew up the next neighborhood over from kew gardens & live in rego park. this checks out for a 1 bed in the area - def a good deal! sign the lease! :) i love kew gardens! lived in nyc my whole life. $2400 is two bedroom territory, or a big ass apt. you’re paying for the area at this point. no lol $2400? that’s already a 2br 1ba unit. i’ll never understand why they don’t add more counter space. there’s definitely room. i’d get a butchers block or something next to the stove. so you don’t have to prep food across the kitchen lol i think it's a great deal for rent stabilized no fee. it looks really spacious as well. congrats! kew garden is nice. nice. yeah that’s good. how’d you find it? i’m looking for a place too i think that’s a good deal. looks nice and clean and updated. enjoy your new place. damn. how did you find this? was it through streeteasy or is there a better way to find rent-stabilized gems like this? how’d you find the stabilized rent apartment tho 2400 for 1 br in kew gardens ? that’s a lot of money, that area you can easily find a 1br for 200-2100.   but you didn’t pay brokers fee + rent stabilized so it’s an ok deal i live in long island about 30mins from queens and have a 2 bed room apt for 3k flat cause the utilities come with it for free and it’s double the size of this. new york is a little bit pricey though but i think you could’ve gotten something more spacious for that price me looking at this with my 3br 1.5 bath for 1050 a month 😯 def don’t live in nyc tho utilities  ?",152,133,positive,0.5146812200546265,285,"is a great place to live. it's time deciding which neighborhood to live in. time deciding which neighborhood to live in. time deciding which neighborhood to live in. i live in rego park and pay 2100 for a 1br. 2400 seems high for kew gardens honestly depends. is there elevator or laundry?

120,4 or more floor walkups. How do you manage?,"[deleted] you tell yourself that mama didn't raise no two trip bitch and carry everything at once! /s   ps, tip your movers extra. to me it’s worth the workout to live on the top floor but to each their own 🤷🏻‍♂️ for anything to be easy, you must first experience it hard. when i lived on the 5th floor i'd sprint up those mfers when i could. made the usual walk up easier. moved from an elevator building to a 4th floor walk up... hire movers. the best deals are on the 1st and 5th floors of walkups! you'll get used to it and it will make you a better person. you didn't move here to have a driveway anyway. i think of it as a mini gym membership that's included with my rent. i like to jog up the stairs and imagine i'm burning like 10 calories every time i come home. i’m on the 5th fl (2 flights of stairs per floor) and i don’t love it lol… but since you don’t have to walk a dog multiple times a day that makes it more manageable imo. personally i find it the most annoying after the gym, the 20 minute walk home from the subway, a night out or large grocery shop. i cheat and get heavy grocery items (seltzer, juice, soda) delivered from the store but that’s $$$ since you also gotta *tip* nicely. but i seem like the lazy ass minority in this thread so idk. i just complain about it a lot. i lived on the top (5th) floor of a walk up for almost 3 years and loved every second of it. people don’t realize what a luxury it is to not have people living above you. i now live on the 3rd floor of a much nicer luxury building in a different city and miss my walk up and not being woken up at 5:30am by my neighbors above me who apparently like to jog around their apartment at that time for two hours as far as groceries and laundry, you can get both delivered. i live in a 4th floor walkup and i get my large  grocery orders delivered to my apartment door rather than going to the store. my friend in a 3rd floor walkup gets her laundry picked up and delivered back to her apartment.  my advice would be doing research on these types of paid services and determining what you can comfortably afford based on your budget. at first it’s hard and then your calves get ripped and it becomes much easier. it’s annoying, but you get used to it. unless you’re buying a ton of groceries, or letting your laundry pile up for weeks, neither are too heavy. and personally i love living on the top floor because i never have to listen to neighbors above me stomping around i lived on a 4th floor walk up for 14 years. now, for me it was a big deal because i’m physically disabled (birth defect in my feet).  i often felt trapped in my house because i knew i couldn’t make it back upstairs.  this won’t be a concern for most people but one thing that happened may affect you at some point. i had another surgery on my foot at hss. i had to *crawl* up the 81 steps to get into my apartment. i threw away my pants after that. not a typical concern but still something to keep in mind. my first apartment in the city was a 5th floor walkup. don't worry about it while you're young, and in shape. it gets easier as you get used to it, not harder! first three months you’ll be pissed off having to do it. by month 7 you’ll be in full submission to the stairs and the lameness of having the carry everything. i live on a fifth floor walk up. i’m young, not fit, have no stamina nor endurance, and it’s fine. well, i struggle and sometimes have to take breaks, but i don’t mind it because i guess it’s good for you to climb steps? and it’s doable. i carry groceries, laundry, packages, and furniture up my 5 flights (steep ones, too!!) i’m a firm believer it shouldn’t be a dealbreaker unless you have a disability or are elderly. you get used to it. except when you have heavy stuff or you’re drunk i think of mine as a moat. it helps keep the riff-raff out and you get to know who your real friends are by whether they'll come up or not. it's really a ""get good"" kinda thing. i lived in a 7th floor walk up on the ues for 6 years. sometimes you haul groceries and laundry up at the same time. you take a break on 5 to catch your breath.  it was easier when i moved in at 28, than when i moved out at 34. great deal, and my ass looked great but enough was enough. i didn’t mind my 4th floor walkup because of the stairs, but the summers were brutal because the windows didn’t open from the top and we were on the top floor, and that apartment just baked. it was hotter inside that it was outside or even in the hallway (and we couldn’t keep the door open for a cross breeze because of our cat). something to keep in mind/check! i live on the 4th/top floor of a laundry-less building. used to live on the 5th floor of a different place. i much rather the top floor because you don’t have to deal with people making noise on top of you.  plus better lighting.  you truly get used to it, and your body stops noticing the effort.  carrying stuff up and down can be a pain, but again, you get used to it. i buy groceries for the week, never more than that.  also, it’s a free workout! just gotta deal with it, typically if not within the constraints of hardship residential buildings with 5 or more stories are required to have an elevator.  i make sure to buy furnishing that can be broken down easily and mattresses that can be folded. think of it as a workout i just think of it as mandatory daily mini workouts that give me an amazing perfect ass i only hate it if i’ve had a long day or if i’m carrying more groceries than anticipated. otherwise, i save money because it’s a free stair master it's a huge pita. i'm not young but i'm relatively fit and i dread those stairs. my partner is older than i am and he really hates living on the 4th floor. we get our groceries delivered from fresh direct just for that reason. we also get our laundry delivered. we're not rich but we splurge on that stuff. if we could manage to move to an elevator building right now we would but it's a crazy rental market. i like living on the top floor. i’m grateful for the extra exercise as a young person i just don’t leave my apartment. 😅 there are “good walk ups” and “bad walk ups.” i lived for 6 years in two “good” fourth floor walk ups — not too steep, landings each half floor. i’ve had friends with crazy steep stairs and that makes a big difference no matter how good of shape you’re in. now i live in an old house in the city with a lot of stairs and i am just kind of used to it. laundry days equal at least 10k steps tho lol. dude, no offence but if you are young and fit walking up 4 flights of stairs, even with chewy boxes, should be nothing.  i put on some weight during covid and am in my late 30's now but it's still not something i ever think about. my fiancee easily carries groceries up and down, only really needs help with something >25ish lbs.   get movers, for sure, but other than that i think you are overthinking it.  not having upstairs neighbors and skyline views are way , way , way worth it. get strong you get use to it. until you start having kids and now you have to take them up and their stuff up. once you make it up you never want to go down until the next day. like everyone else says moving is the real kicker. had to break down most of my furniture to actually move out. i lived for three years on the fifth floor of a walk up. yeah you just stop noticing it eventually. i lived on a 4th floor walkup for 3 years and swore never again. top floor is choice for no one above you but i have that in an elevator building and never looking back.  had to deal with elevator outage for 3-4 days and with dogs going out multiple times a day during a heatwave....woof you basically just build strength and the big packages are always a struggle. the worst part is when you get home from a trip, coming from a long flight and you then have to carry your suitcase up 5/6 flights of stairs. most days if i just have my regular stuff it’s not a problem really. i am on a third floor. i don't feel like i'd care if i was one more floor up. however, my friends who are in 5th or 6th floor (where they are allowed) walkups i think they are insane.     it probably helps i have laundry in unit. the only thing i carry up are amazon packages. most grocery delivery services (amazon fresh is what i used, occasionally wildfork) seem to bring food parcels too door. so does uber eats. i think standard practice for these places is they have to show the item was actually brought to the door with door number or handed to a customer. just think you’re saving money & getting free exercise   definitely a problem in the long term, for example, if you twist your ankle you’re gonna have a hard time going anywhere   sadly there are elderly people stuck in old tenement walk ups and can’t get down when needed i went from a 3rd floor walk up, to 5th floor, to 4th floor, to 4th floor again. honestly i hardly think about it. plus i have skinny legs i’m trying to bulk up, i just see it as a mini leg workout every day 🤪 moving sucks though. i lived in a 5th floor walkup. i got heavy groceries delivered (and tipped). i hated laundry day (mostly because i tended to save up laundry and do several loads at once). and some grocery days. and moving sucked. but i also was on the top floor so it was quiet. and cheap. and i was in good shape.  for me, it was worth it. i never thought about stairs until the year i broke my leg.  that’s all i can really say.  only elevator buildings for me now. i just plan my outings so that i have to climb up the least amount of times during the day lmao. moving in was horrendous and there are definitely days where it’s worse than others because nyc is hard enough, but at the end of the day at least your legs/ass will look nice ! i live in a fourth floor walkup and do my laundry at a laundromat. i bought a laundry backpack to carry the clothes. much easier than dragging a cart up and down the stairs. you can get anything delivered in nyc.  groceries, laundry, dry cleaning, liquor, etc .. i used to live in a 4 floor walk up and i just had everything delivered! you tell yourself it’s good for you heavy breathing 🤣 i live in a 4th floor apartment walk up right now and it is exhausting at times esp when you have laundry, groceries, deliveries. but it’s a good daily workout lol and you do get used to it as others said  the moving sucks tremendously, like i was out for 3 days after just sleeping after bringing everything up alone with my dad - took over 4 hrs. i would suggest hiring movers and eat the cost cause it was not worth it to do it on my own lmao   i got a great deal on the apt so i def don’t regret it, if you see an apt you like idt this should deter you! i usually take the stairs and cry you'll get the perfect peach ass do you count the ground floor 1? cause i am on 3rd floor but it says 4th floor. i am european and i find this crazy. ground should be 0 and first floor should be 1. anyway. i live on 3rd or 4th floor (open to interpretation) and i don’t care at all. i sometimes forget about it until someone says something. i am over 40 and i smoke sometimes how about just dealing with it? lol it sucks!!! i lived in one when i was a kid and it was a lot. but apartments are hard to find so if you can find a happy medium that would be helpful for your predicament. i always wanted to have a pulley system to help with the heavy stuff 😂 but it's not feasible.  good luck! its good exercise bro  i wish i had a 6 floor walk up we have the 5th and 6th floor in a walk up. i just do one large load of laundry dry at a time and shop slightly more frequently so i carry less groceries.   i don’t mind it at all. moving all of our stuff (including furniture) into the apt in one day was the only part that really truly sucked you know those metal shopping carts you always see people lugging around their groceries and laundry in? when youre dealing with carrying things up a walk-up -- thats your biggest friend. you don’t sound cut out. move to an elevator building with the geriatrics this is really crazy, i can't even think about this i’m in a 4th floor building with an elevator. but after reading all your comments i’m going to start using the stairs for my fitness and end my gym membership 😉 you get used to it very quickly. it’s honestly very good for your health to take the stairs. unless someone is physically disabled this really shouldn’t be an issue to worry about.  edit: i have dragged mattresses and large furniture up my four story walk up. slightly humbling but very doable consider a portable laundry machine for your apartment- that way you only have to carry large items once in a while. recently moved to a four floor walkup and the move in was brutal. me and my partner did it all ourselves… definitely hiring movers next time  as for the daily task of going up and down the stairs, i’m young and fit and it never gets easier 😂 but at least its a semi- workout we used to be on the 5th floor of a walk up.  you just do it and complain for the 2 minutes you are carrying something up the stairs and then move on and get back to your life.    wouldn’t consider it a big deal at all unless you had some sort of issue that would prevent you from carrying/walking up that many flights of stairs regularly.    being lazy is a bad reason not to do it in my opinion especially if you get a good deal on the apartment. 5th floor here! you get used to it, and it's like having a built in gym lol  i love my stair climbing granny cart though, i don't have a washer/dryer in unit or in building, so it's perfect for lugging laundry to the laundromat and easily pulling it all back upstairs. great for groceries too!  sometimes if i need to bring up an extra heavy package i strap it onto the platform on the cart and bring it up that way. i have been staying in a friends 4th floor walk up for a month now and i fkn hate it, no higher than the third floor for me pls as with anything in nyc you just get used to it. that said if i forget anything (looking at you umbrella) i think long and hard about going back for it. i believe the maximum height of a nyc apartment building with no elevator is four or five floors.  i lived on the 5th floor of a 7-story apartment building, and we lost our elevator for nine weeks due to it being completely replaced.  the first week or so was a bit rough. but it actually got easier as time went on. if you really are physically fit, you should be fine after a few weeks.  if for any reason you ever decide to do a grocery delivery, like from stop & shop, they will walk up a maximum of four flights of stairs for the delivery. you won’t get fat! and it’s kind of peaceful being on the top floor. no clomping above you and no hallway noise or street noise. i miss my old 5 th floor walk up apartment. 6th floor walk up here but i'm in pretty good shape and regularly work out multiple times a week. it's not definitely not for old or seriously injured people. cat litter deliveries are the worst problem but take it slow and it's no problem. for other big deliveries, i open the box downstairs, throw stuff in a backpack, and make multiple trips if i have to. every day life is no problem at all but my worst fear is getting a severe lower body injury. i’m 23, and fit as well but i think it’s great exercise. i’m up a 5th floor walk up and moved in pretty much everything myself. ever since then walking and carrying the occasional bag of groceries isn’t bad at all.  also no upstairs neighbors is great i'm in my third year living in a fourth floor walk up and i have a dog. i have spent close to $200 to buy my own portable washing machine which has been a lifesaver. i also use a backpacking backpack (one that has a clasp at the waist to help distribute the weight) for bringing groceries home. i also bought a cart that is specifically made for climbing stairs. i grouped my activities together such as i take the trash out at the same time i take the dog out. it's definitely doable and i honestly don't notice too much anymore personally, i did it once and would never do it again, but obviously it's a ""to each their own"" thing. the moving in and out part is a serious pain in the ass (seriously. you're going to question every life choice you ever made during those moves), but if you're willing to overlook those couple weeks of torture, it is very nice getting a top floor view and also knowing you get a small leg day almost everyday of the week. for heavy packages i used to open the box at the foot of the stairs, then make multiple trips up with the contents.  finally bring the box, already downstairs, to recycling. if you're young with stamina and endurance this is not an issue at all. i carried a baby up to the 5th floor with a stroller for 8 months and barely noticed on a daily basis. lived on 5th floor walk up and honestly you get used to it.  you can grab small batches of groceries vs big hauls.  worst is coming back after travel and carrying the suitcase all the way up.  hire a team of movers and tip well, moving won’t be that bad bc it only happens once.  the regular walk up becomes a standard microdose of cardio one criteria i had when i moved was a building with an elevator. even if you opt for the stairs on the daily, the elevator is handy when you have heavy things and for moving 3rd floor for 7 years. carry a mountain bike down all the time. it’s like a life gift in a demented way.  you’ll have many thoughts on your climb daily the upside is that between a 4 floor walk up (no laundry on site so had to carry my things to the laundromat) and 40 min round trip walk to work i was able to maintain my weight without additional exercise. i grew up on a 4th fl walk-up. you don't really notice it. as a kid, i loved counting the stairs as i was going up. we also had a dog and since the building door didn't close all the way, we would just open the apartment door and once he was done, he'd come back and scratch the apartment door to be let in again. mind you, this was in a gated community where loose dogs weren't a rarity. it was also a few decades ago. but i digressed. op, if you love it, go for it, especially now that you're young and energetic. it sucks - i don’t mind walking up and down daily when i’m not carrying things, but when it comes to lugging heavy things up and heavy trash down, and especially moving, it’s terrible. i just moved to a 3rd floor walk up and despite obnoxious, twisting stairs and passages it’s still easier than 4 flights (in a place with high ceilings nevertheless.) every day is leg day with all the flash flooding happening, you’ll appreciate being dry with strong legs! you get used to it. i have a granny cart with stair climber wheels that helps a lot with getting large bags of laundry up and down the stairs. i used avant garde moving 2x to get my mom moved from pa to nj and then from my house in nj to her new condo 30 min away. they are based in brooklyn. they charge flat rates not per hour so so matter how long it takes, you won’t get a surprise fee. you tell them the details and inventory of what’s being moved and you get a quote and contract. it’s not the cheapest but it’s also not as expensive as many other movers based out of nyc. they wrap everything, disassemble whatever you need, and come with 3-4 guys in a large truck. super nice and professional. i’d reach out and get quotes from them.   an example: to move my mom’s 2 bedroom house in the poconos (2 flights of stairs in home) to my house in nj, plus a stop to unload the large furniture at her storage unit was $1700 all inclusive. that was tolls, fees for stairs, 2 stops, gas, travel time, the 4 men, packing supplies and tax. worth every penny. it was stress free and my mom didn’t have to do anything. first apartment in nyc was a 5th floor walk up and i hated it. i am fit and go to the gym 5x a week but it was still dreadful leaving and coming back. it would keep me from leaving the apartment sometimes. i do have dogs though, so that played into my distaste of it. moved out after a year because i couldn’t stand it anymore i’m a relatively small woman and love my 4th floor walkup! it’s actually made me feel healthier having to do the steps when i leave. and yeah, after a couple months i hardly notice now.  have ordered some furniture i needed to carry up in “pieces” ie new round dining table, but there’s always ways to add straps / “handles” to things.  the only reason i took this apartment was because it had in-unit laundry + balcony. without laundry, i probably wouldn’t do it. this will be great for your long term health i grew up living mostly in walk ups. you deal with it. any heavy packages i used those granny carts or a hand truck and got my workout out in for the day.   once a building gets up to 6 floors, an elevator is installed so maybe see if you have luck finding an apt in a 6 story building? i'm on a 6th floor walk up. it builds character for sure. got used to it after a few months. always give yourself more time to get places.   more exercise is good overall imo. welcome to nyc life…. i’ve lived like that for 10 years. now out in long island and with an elevator and washer and dryer. you get annoyed with arms full of groceries for about 10 mins then you’re in your house and you get over it. i am about to buy a wheeled carrier though you get used to it! took me like 4 months to not even notice. my legs looked nice and my heart rate also finally got used to it. this is coming from an anemic who had to get blood transfusions. it does suck from time to time with groceries but eventually it’s not something you think about it i live on the 6th floor and i have a dog, so i’m going up and down stairs all day lol. but honestly i’ve been doing it almost three years now and you get used to it after the first few weeks. i dont even get winded unless i’m sprinting. re: groceries, i get mine delivered weekly and just bring it up from the lobby. it’s not difficult since i’m only feeding myself. what will really kill you is having to walk up those stairs when you come home drunk at 3am. everything else is relatively easy. don’t do it in my opinion in the long run, it’s not a good choice because something could always change one day you can get a lot of groceries or maybe a big target order or something like that or maybe even catching a flight somewhere in the long run it’s not worth it even if you find it annoying (which is understandable), in the long run your body will thank you for it. it's actually quite beneficial to your body to have this short bit of exercise walking up and down daily. my great-aunt did it until she was 95.  you will be fine and it’s great cardio.  you just never move until they put you in an old age home. wagon cart for groceries! i love my 4th-floor walk up. it’s pretty and it gets tons of sunlight. i’m in nyc so i’m constantly walking anyway, a few stairs don’t bother me. you get used to it and your legs look amazzinngg i grew up in a 4th floor walk up in manhattan, you don’t know what/who awaits you on each landing. security is a real concern. my friends would ring the bell and i would throw the key out the window so they could come up. no buzzer due to crime. eventually gave the place up after mom broke her hip snd could no longer make the stairs. yes, i was in great shape due to running up and down. 6th floor walkup checking in. somehow got a rent controlled 2 bedroom apt to myself on a covid deal. literally can't leave now so i have accepted my (not so terrible) fate.",149,181,neutral,0.4021846354007721,330,"i carry my're elderly. i'm a 5th floor walk up. it's fine. unless you have a disability or are elderly.'re moving. then you get used to it. have to carry it up stairs. then you get used to it. i live on the 5th floor. i have to carry my groceries, laundry, and packages.. i..."
121,Dog did serious damage to apartment…worried about eviction,"they won’t evict you. no need to worry about that. they might make you pay the damages tho ￼​  ftr, this is tommy and he weighs 27 pounds and i have no fucking clue how he could even do this in such a short period of time.  https://preview.redd.it/9zbzkrf6poed1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c415fafc7f231335ee9165491c2634f73488d177 pay a handyman/someone to fix it for you and it won’t be a problem for anyone only chance of eviction would maybe be if landlord wasn’t aware of dog and it violated lease. my brother almost got evicted because he had a pit bull, lied about its breed in application, then it drove the entire building crazy with barking echoing others here, get this shit fixed asap! my concern here would be the potential for pests to get in through there lol he has opened the gates to hell  my pup had similar anxiety and so we were forced to crate train her too :) she chewed off the metal thing that attached to bottom of the door! i also caught her chewing into drywall when she was a six month old crackhead, so not surprising to see this haha but definitely shocking! good on you for being solutions oriented lol you are not going to get evicted for this as it seems you’ve already spoken to your super. your pup is super cute! get your dog some training! crate train him. it will save your doggie. it's not at all cruel, and your dog will adjust to loving the crate in no time. just make sure the crate is neither too big nor too small. lol it’s gonna be okay. patch of drywall (expose the nearest stud first), replace whatever insulation came out, paint over it, and you’re gucci what everyone else said but gonna add: this is a good way for a dog to get an obstruction. that will run you thousands if he needs surgery. it sounds like you've got a plan but just wanted to put that on your radar as well. gotta make sure he is more secure when he is alone. i'd start crate training with super high value treats. ?! how.....??? i recommend getting a professional trainer to help with the separation anxiety or at least buy the book by julie naismith.  a bark collar might stop him barking but he’s just redirecting the anxiety to other behaviors - like this.  traz works but tranquilizing your dog is obviously not ideal if you can train him out of it. my dog was satan when he was a puppy. ate a door, towels, underwear, socks, my wedding dress (🙄). crates are a big help and he eventually mellowed out. lots of exercise is also a big help, but vets do prescribe anxiety meds for dogs if you feel like that’s the right move! we did for a bit when we moved across the country and it helped a lot! it is $100 a month though :/ jezus christ. locking him in/out of rooms, gates, bark collar, neutered, reduced to a crate, drugged, and are now considering giving him away?? the poor dog. you don't deserve him. please don't have pets before you're ready to. what kind of fucking ""dog"" do you have? patch that hole yourself, youtube buddy exercise and more exercise for him, please! people like you are why we're all fucked in the rental market with either pet fees or no pets allowed. poor doggo, is he getting enough exercise? also that hole can be easily fixed, i wouldn’t worry. don’t just give him a bunch of sedative drugs. find him a doggy day care and go to puppy training classes. work hard to train your dog rather than drugging him patch it it’s actually a really easy fix. if the wall i’m assuming is drywall. somebody could come and patch that up. all you would need is to match the paint when you paint it over if your super takes too long, i found rocky’s repairs and renovations on thumbtack. i had ryan (the owner i think) repair my walls before i moved out of my last place. very reasonable and quick!   https://www.thumbtack.com/ny/brooklyn/handyman/rockys-repairs-renovations-llc/service/492103965801553936 it doesn’t look that big or bad. just fix it and don’t tell the landlord. get training for your dog goo to taskrrabbit hi, your pup may be bored, anxious, and in need of more exercise. aside from taking him out more (or get a walker if it's not possible), try filling a kong toy with peanut butter (no salt or sugar), and then freeze it. that ought to keep him entertained a while. he may just need more love and attention too. just a thought :) best of luck! looks like you have good advice already from a bunch of replies. that’s awesome to hear your super is cool.  our friend’s dog once just chewed a hole and kept gnawing at it til it got pretty big — did damage in a couple of hours or so. luckily she owned her own home…which probably isn’t “lucky” at all from her perspective lol that dog obviously needs more drywall in his diet. need to be worried about the rats having a garage door considering you live in ny. pay and tip your super—it will be fine and the ll does not need to know my dog had terrible separation anxiety as a puppy and literally did the same thing. i came home horrified not even realizing something like this was a possibility. it definitely looks dramatic but someone from task rabbit came and fixed it easily and i had no problems with my building over it at all. everyone’s advice here is solid. fix it yourself (or get your cool super to do it for you and give him a good tip), training, trazodone (i use this for my own dog for highly stressful situations like fireworks and thunder), walk/exercise him super early am and after sunset when it’s cooler but also want to add that if you don’t have pet insurance, look into it! i’ve saved thousands over the 12 years i’ve had my dog. she’s had an obstruction, and mast cell tumors (cancerous) removed on two different occasions, and then many many trips to the vet here and there for smaller things, but they add up. lots of affordable plans out there. good luck, your pup looks like a sweet little guy. a cat would never 😔 bruh holy fuck stop drugging your dog and locking him in a crate and fucking train him.   why people get dogs like they’re little toys you can just put on the shelf when you’re done is beyond me.    not trying to be a total ass, but you’re the reason there’s so many rules and laws around dogs and renting. you’re reacting like he’s the problem and that’s why it’s never getting fixed. you don’t fix separation anxiety and hyperactivity with dog gates and drugs. you need to walk him often and train him not to bark when you leave. our trainer told us to feed our dog in the crate. the crate should be a place they want to go. he’s so cute!🐾 keep dog in a comfortable crate. it’s not punishment; it’s training and establishing boundaries. aside from the damage, the cost to repair, potential eviction...your dog does not like to be left alone, and this is her/his way of telling you. you need a crate, to be home at least once during the day to let her/him out, and you need to realize that dogs are social, not solitary creatures. google “drywall repair” or “plaster and drywall repair” and you’ll see all sorts of youtube videos. it’s shockingly easy. you need to crate train your dog. my dog had horrible separation anxiety and getting a trainer was life changing and people are afraid of cats ruining apartments? you need to walk your dog more often. my anxious dog did this too. we had to fix it- it wasn’t a big deal. i would keep working on your vet with your anxious dog. we have ours on gabapentin along with the traz & that has helped. good luck! if this is the entrance door for the apt. your puppy just wanted to be with you. every day, whenever, what ever time. say a phrase like…….i am going to work. shut and lock the door. if you have a container for your lunch or whatever, take those with you. leave for 10 minutes. come back,say good puppy, whatever you want. pet your pup. than, wait 20 minutes, and start over again. yes, “will take long time grasshopper”. it work. dam it! it just works! you're probably better off just watching the wall. you're not getting evicted ask the super for the paint code that's not a hard fix. cut it out so it's even and cut out a piece of sheetrock to fill it then use plaster and paint easy fix, hardest part would be matching the paint yeah literally just fix it (extremely well) and you’ll be fine. just gonna cost some moneys do not even mention to your ll. either way you’re paying for the damages. only difference is if you get someone on your own, it will be 50x cheaper. that’s the most basic fix of all time. my dog when a puppy ate a hole in my drywall.  easy fix by handyman i would not bring in a hand man.  that may violate your lease. the only way for them to find out is if you tell them. also that’s why you pay deposit. hint if that’s my building i would evict you immediately. just fix it or have it fixed easy echo what others have said, would add that you might need to cover the floors as well, that's a more expensive repair than a bit of sheetrock. a can of spackle and some paint. you got a 2 hour project. sorry that was me i just got really hungry :( separation anxiety. better treat it or your dog might hurt itself you’re fucked. cut the damage part of the wall out. get a sheetrock that size. plaster it up, sand and paint the whole room this should be a easy fix. maybe get a friend with some handy man experience or youtube. regarding the dog…definitely need to get one of those doggy cams before your neighbors start complaining. i had a dog like that and they had no problem with me paying to fix the damage. good luck. i would just buy a bucket of spackle and fill it up like crazy and paint it... will cost like $30.no one will prob be able to tell the difference from the outside pay for the door replacement !! you will be fine fix it yourself or hire someone and you will be alright. tbh i can fix it for you just pay someone to patch the wall up hire someone to fix the wall. it’ll be much cheaper than being charged by the landlord.  glad you finally got a crate. you need to get him trained. good luck. you sure you got a dog not a baby bear? took me 30seconds to realize that the dog put a massive hole in the wall.. i thought it was a rag on the door, and i had a confused look of what did the dog do?? didn’t realize you’ve tamed cerebus just go to home depot and get small sheetrock and patchit up.. you need to cut it more square. and the  screw 2-3 strips of board to  the inside of the hole for a back to the sheetrock. get plaster.$100, like nothing happend..   youtube that sh!t its not going to take long..   need to learn now for the future holes in the wall. it would be more financially wise to train your dog for this to not happen again. i can’t with bad dog owners i’ve seen worse, you’ll be fine. you can pay to have it repaired by a third party handyman or pay the landlord at the end of the lease. the concerning part would be why the dog did that. if it’s separation anxiety then you need to train him to avoid it in the future, it’s not easy but it’s also necessary to cohabitate. chill. your anxiety becomes your dogs anxiety.   the damage looks superficial. you can call a handyman or contractor. drywall repair is relatively cheap. angi.com can get you a quote for the cost.  if you involve your landlord you’re likely to loose your security deposit + whatever they charge you for repairs.  - crating your dog is a band-aid not a permanent solution. imagine how you would feel. just one women’s opinion… the contractor who renovated my place is very knowledgeable, i’d be happy to share his info with you.   also, the building might have insurance requirements or work hours limitations to consider. my building does and my contractor fulfilled all the requirements (he’s worked on several units in the building over the years.) does your “dog” go crazy if it gets wet by chance? find a friend that can do sheet rock and it should be expensive at all. smh i kicked in my door as a teenager and when i was moving out as an adult, i was told to fix it or pay. i just bought a new door. i’d like 80 bucks at home depot and easy to install.   since yours looks like a hole in the wall you need to fix that quick, we live in new york we don’t not want to know what’s in the walls  honestly though they’re probably not going to say anything until you leave the apartment or ask for your deposit back that’s literally the map of palestine evicted the dog first what kind of dog do you have ? trazadone is not a long term solution!  a dog should not take that daily.  that’s like a human taking ambien daily.  get him on prozac or something like that they gonna find a way to make you pay ... at the minimum you'll have to get rid of the pooch... fix that shit on your own ... ( i dont think a dog would do that...) pitbull? 💀 super easy fix for someone who knows what their doing bro do you have a pet alligator? ain’t no way that’s a dog hire a contractor if you dont know hoe to sheetrock and paint i would put some perspex over the repair so this doesn’t happen again. pack your bags patch it up you could get evicted. depends on your relationship with the landlord. if yall on good terms i wouldn't worry about it. if you're a shit tenant your ass gon b gone. i’m a handy man in the bronx, i’ll fix it for $250 okay i’m gonna be so so so real here so please no one down vote me to hell.   maybe the city is not the best place for your dog. you might have to re home him. which is beyond sad as he looks like a cutie. i feel like i constantly hear “oh my pet doesn’t have a mean bone in its body!” “they’re the sweetest i promise!” and this is for everyone - no one at all doubts that you have a sweet dog. but if your dog is not trained it is a liability and could hurt itself or someone else.   op your dog and your neighbors shouldn’t have to suffer just because you want a dog this takes 20 min to fix if it’s just drywall it’s not a terrible fix, but a dog did this?? that’s concerning i made a mistake once drilling a hole too big. our apt has a weird setup with studs (they’re not entirely evenly spaced). anyway, i couldn’t put a bracket in so i decided to cut a square and patch it with a new drywall square i cut out. it worked and it was fairly simple to do. below is an example of how to do it.  https://youtu.be/fdy9urvpi-e you need to train your dog and get it more socialized. you could fix that yourself youtube a video it’s not that hard you're dog did that? .... yeah id definitely be worried... fix it yourself don't tell the land lord please don't try to do the repair yourself although your dog damaged the wall you can remedy that by being upfront with your landlord and paying for repairs without being evicted but if you exact your own repairs including painting the wall and blending it into the existing color and your landlord finds out after the fact that might be a reason to be evicted. hire a wall repair service from taskrabbit that’s an easy fix op. youtube on how to replace that. tommy needs more exercise [deleted] tell the landlord asap, be ready to pay for all repairs. consider that you're destroying someone else's property by having a dog there.   imho, this type of damage can be a cause for eviction. don't attempt to repair on your own.",148,224,neutral,0.4206889271736145,372,get it fixed.’s house repainted and he did a great job. my house repainted and he did a great job. my house repainted and he did a great job. i had my dog evicted because he chewed through the wall. get fixed. get.. get! get....!
122,Cutting the line at an open house? ,"yes, you should have spoken up. but the more important race is getting in a completed application.  you being ready with all of your financial documents can make up for any time lost waiting to get in an apartment. you should’ve spoke up. that’s what i would’ve done. lines and line etiquette are serious business here, as is apartment hunting. people trying to circumvent a line in hopes of screwing everyone behind them need to catch hell for it. the people on line with you will support you if you’re the one who speaks up. whether or not someone trying to snipe an apartment from you thinks you’re being rude or mean by confronting them doesn’t matter. who gets the apartment matters. a simple “there’s a line; you arrived after [whoever].” will do it. lean into your larry david and call these cutters outtttttt forgive the rant.  the problem is not the line cutter, the problem is the agent.  i do \*not\* understand why agents do this.  it is never in the best interest of the owner that the agent is representing.  it's just silly and lazy.  first of all, how do you know the first person in line is qualified?  second, what if the second or third person in line would have offered you more money?  third, how do you know that the other people in that line might not become clients in some other way? maybe they have a condo to sell, you never know, treat people well and your business will grow. or just karma.  let everyone see the apartment, let everyone put in their applications, see which one is the strongest.  not only is this more humane and fair, it is better for everyone involved.  this makes me grumpy,  suzanne yes yes, absolutely call out these mf'ers. i've been to several open houses where aggro idiots came with all their paperwork to only cut the line, offer first and last in cash and not be called out for it. my go to line is ""you got a problem or you want me to give you one?"" broker here- i add a scheduling link to my oh listings for this very reason- everyone is allotted a 5-10 minute slot - already designated. if someone is late, they have to wait. it eliminates the chaos.   i include the list of app requirements in the calendar invite and folks who want to move forward can receive the link to apply once they see the unit. open to suggestions but this is what has worked for me- i would rather not have the tour feel competitive or anxiety ridden. here's the way you manage it. if you're the first in line, take out a paper and pen and put your name down. then as people arrive, they put their name on the list. with a few names down, you'll have enough people with an investment to enforce the line policy. you'll have a half dozen or more people telling the line cutters to get on the list. when you enter the apartment, you hand the list to the next person. they hand it to the next person, etc.  if you're not the first in line, you can sometimes try to get the others in front of you to start a list. they will understand that it's a way for them to enforce their position. most people are reasonable and will want to make a list. you will encounter weasels from time to time, but in general, written lists work.  but you need a paper and pen. i’ve had this happen to me. i told him i was here first (5 minutes before him). then the guy proceeds to try to rant and guilt me by saying hes already seen 7 places from the same broker and can’t get approved for one. i let him go first because i didn’t want to argue. all for him to not get it and for me to be the current renter now you did the right thing. let them cut and then later that night ask anonymous strangers on reddit their opinion! at this rate you’ll have a new apartment in no time! yes, just like any other line. bitch and complain all you want do you need permission for everything in life? or just standing up for yourself? this is nyc. toughen soy boy.",147,48,negative,0.5293421745300293,195,you can you can be a bitchy soy boy. but this is nyc. toughen up soy boy. you can be a bitchy soy boy. but this is nyc. toughen up. you can be a bitchy soy boy. but this is nyc. toughen up. and be nice to everyone. and be nice to everyone. and be nice to everyone. and be nice to everyone
123,Broker’s fee for a lease renewal?!,"brokers are out of control, this is totally ridiculous, don't pay it that’s not legal. broker fee is a 1 time fee. that doesn't sound legal. maybe you should file a complaint.   [https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/08/realestate\_guide\_08-20-21.pdf](https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/08/realestate_guide_08-20-21.pdf) local news would love this huge no no. a brokers fee is a 1 time fee, not a renewal fee in perpetuity for your stay in the apartment. the broker is for the landlord + tenant match transaction once and only once.   … does the landlord know the broker has asked you for an additional fee?? this happened last month. i immediately ended the renewal talks and told her i would be moving. criminal behavior these vermin are out of their fucking minds. you should ask her for $5000 to avoid a story in the local news sounds insane, and where did she get the price tag of $5000?  was that what she needed to pay for her debt?  if brokers get fees for every lease renewals, all of them would be millionaires from collecting fees for a house they showed 25 years ago. god damn vampires this is normal only for commercial space not rental apartments. report her lol  dont pay . i've heard of somebody having to pay a new broker's fee when they move between apartments in the same building and sign a new lease on the new apartment. but never for the same apartment this is not legal. i’d report it. i have never heard of this and it is insane and almost certainly illegal. i would report it. not sure where but 311 is a good place to start. alert public advocate office too. aww she’s cute. oh, and insane. tell her to get fucked and call the landlord directly. you think the landlord wants a gap in between renters?   this lady is rolling the dice that you’ll cower after getting coked up and hammered with some other degenerate bottom-feeder who convinced her that we’re all suckers who deserve to be squeezed until we pop. i say go around her and if the landlord balks you need to be ready to relocate. let’s face it, one broker fee is one too many, so this asshole trying to double dip?!?! maybe the bbb would be interested? fuck this city let’s start shaming these agencies. since the courts made this mandatory let’s make sure they start doing their fucking jobs and not straight thievery over laziness. don’t pay it.. but don’t think you have to move either. you’re already in the apartment, and that gives you a lot of leverage. i've never heard of this this smells not legal  no such thing as a brokers fee for a renewal  see if the apartment building is under good cause eviction  there are a few exemptions for buildings so first see if your building is required to follow it  if so - 10% is illegal for an increase talk to the owner directly . chances are that he’s not even aware . not legal, file a complaint with dhcr wow i am a broker and in my 30 years never heard about a broker fee in a renewal if she manages the apartment the landlord pays her, you don't get a brokers fee on a lease renewal. report her ass! she needs to lose her real estate license. this is illegal, please report them to the attorney generals office talk to the landlord, they probably aren’t happy about this you should contact the ny real estate board to enquire about/ report this. https://dos.ny.gov/nys-board-real-estate fucking absurd. what is the name of this agency? that is standard practice on commercial real estate.  might be that the landlord has a commercial relationship with the broker. the law does not explicitly limit broker fees, but they are intended to be payment for services rendered and when they’re this egregious, the state might just step in like they did when a broker thought he’d charge nearly 20k for a rent stabilized apt. at that time, hochul put out this press release and encouraged people to file complaints. https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-action-against-real-estate-brokerage-firm-charging-excessive-broker. if your broker is licensed, this threat might be helpful. good luck! hi! this is not legal seems like the owner is using the broker to get you to leave tbh. check with a lawyer to see if this is legal.",145,71,negative,0.889521062374115,216,"i remember when a broker thought he’d charge nearly 20k for a rent stabilized apt. the state stepped in and stopped the broker. i remember when a broker thought he’d charge nearly 20k for a rent stabilized apt. the state is not explicitly limiting broker fees, but they are intended to be payment for services rendered and when they’re this egregious, the state might just step in like"
124,"Is it at all possible to make $2,100 rent on a $78K+ salary?","tight but doable. you’ll pretty much be choosing between saving and having fun though. would be very tough to do both. [deleted] your income with your weekend job should make it easier. it’s tough but by my calculations you should still have like 2.5-3k leftover a month.  in new york that doesn’t go super far but if you can get your expenses down to 2k then you can pocket 500-1k a month to build up your savings. for now though, if your savings are depleted, it’s probably in your best interest to hermit mode the next few months and build up a buffer. i make 75k and pay $2.5k in rent. i have money left over for fun and a little for saving. it works somehow. i'm not much of a budgeter so i'll admit, i have no idea how i make it work but i do. [zillow rent calculator](https://www.zillow.com/rent-affordability-calculator)  $78k is roughly $4,813/month **net**  according to zillow, you can afford $2118 in rent  and you’ll have $2695 left over for everything else.   considering you likely won’t have a car in nyc, i’d say you probably could afford this with good budgeting practices. keep in mind you will probably get a better job in the future and this is temporary.   i’d be more concerned with qualifying for the 40x rule. in any other market you’d qualify, but in nyc the 40x rule might halt you from even getting the chance to rent. i was making around $75k and paid $2250 rent. i didn’t contribute any 401k while i was making this. and i had a $500/mo debt payment. so it’s doable. i knew i was going to make a lot more the next year, so i made it work for a year. i make 72k and pay 2100 anything is possible i make 85k and pay $2275 in nyc - and still contribute $100/week to my ira and 5% to my 401k, plus save a few hundred every month. not a huge budgeter but i can spend roughly $1000 a month on fun stuff on top of that and be fine 🤷🏼‍♀️ yes it’s possible but things will be quite tight. i’d keep applying to and interviewing for jobs while you work this new job so that you can hopefully land somewhere closer to your previous compensation. without knowing the specifics i’d say it’s possible but man this situation is so triggering. i’ve made over 100k here but always feel like a layoff is possible so never sign leases like this. $2100 to live in an apt in crown heights just feels so dystopian to me.  you can get a better paying job, i’d apply more efforts to that than trying to work every single day for the next..year?? that’s not really realistic and i think the burn out could put both jobs at risk.   if possible as a plan b, i’d try to get off the lease, and find some friends / roommates off listings projects. the difference between living alone in ny and even having one roommate is like $1,000 a month.   also sorry this is happening to you, i’ve come to the conclusion that living in nyc is like being in a relationship with an abusive partner and at some point i just need to walk away. there are beautiful cities around the world where a 1br would be half the cost and probably have a balcony overlooking a cute plaza with shops and markets. i think this is my last year in brooklyn to really dig into it, utilize one of the budget templates on excel and fill it in as detailed as could be to get your monthly savings. obviously you can do this on a sheet of paper but sometimes the templates help paint a better picture and capture some pieces you may miss it’a doable! a bit tight, but i managed. that was slightly less than i made before i was laid off and the rental amount is similar. if you’re great at budgeting - it can work well! i was not lmao. i used to pay 2100 making 75k. you’ll be ok!! i make 77k while paying $1950 in rent. money will be tight for you but it’s do-able with good budgeting practices. you’ll have to spend a weekend or two per month at home doing nothing, not eating out, etc. i make $75k rent, have a $1900 rent, and also have a car which i pay insurance/car payment monthly for. so yes, it is absolutely doable and i think you can still live pretty comfortably. yes budget and live frugal it can be done. can you get a roommate? if you don’t have a spare room maybe consider sleeping on the couch & renting out your room to a traveling nurse. no longterm commitment, you could do it for just a few months & use the money to pay off other bills so you have some breathing room. also maybe look into a perrine job that you could do with flexible hours so at least you can be home, or if you have any bartender or serving experience, see if you can find a part time job with an event company. you can pick & choose what events you want to work & might make some good money in. tips you should get a roommate and focus on rebuilding and paying back your debt. [deleted] i was paying 2100 on 65k and doing fine tbh. wasn’t going on big vacations or anything, but wasn’t miserly pinching pennies. wishing you the best of luck! life is tough right now you’ll have to budget and might not have as much to save / do fun stuff but it’s doable. tight but doable like most people have said. i don’t know your other expenses. but during covid my rent was $1500 on a $55,000 salary. tight, doable, i had no fun during covid so i guess it worked out. hoping things workout for you though. you got this! everything is really really really hard right now. the fact that you are able to get up every day and go to two crappy underpaying jobs and persevere is incredible. you're doing an amazing job given the circumstances and there will be a way out of the woods some day!!!!! keep going!! i’ve made that rent with way less salary. like 55k. austerity is how it works. i don’t drink or smoke cigarettes and i rarely eat out. i’ve been paying $1800 for 3 years making less than 50k.  it’s tight for sure but you’ll need to relax a bit you’re still better than most people with 78k and rent that’s only $2100 in new york i did 2,300 before when i was making 75k on my full time due to a lease ending at the worst time (summer). it was honestly a terrible deal but i needed a place asap. i made a conscious decision to do more freelance work to ease my mind financial. my income is now $130-140k but my rent is 2,2 and lifestyle wise act as if i’m still earning the way i did before.  i do think rent or mortgages shouldnt be more than 1/3 of your income for you to be able to live decent (depends on your lifestyle and debts too) and do the trifecta (save, invest & have fun). but i’d say 2,1 on a 78k salary is doable (could be better if it was 1,5-1,7 range) but as long as your lifestyle is humble. anything after like freelance, gigs and part time will be a bonus. $78k is greater than the median income for an entire household in nyc and nearly double the median individual income.  $2,100 is a little over the 40x guideline, but would be doable for the vast majority of people. the real question is how much debt you racked up while unemployed, which seems to be the real issue. you can do it. i'm cheering for you. also got laid off in jan. job market is terrible. yes, i’m exactly in that salary range and rent - you can afford it tough but you can do it i think it’s more than doable but i would heavily look at what you’re spending money on besides rent. like you may be overpaying for groceries/ eating every meal out/subscriptions (prob don’t need amazon) i make 100k, contribute 8% to my 401k and i’m paying 2200 a month. it is doable, but i track my spending to the penny. there are months that i spend more than i earn, but usually not by much. i rarely earn more than i spend though, i break close to even. i have savings accruing interest in cds but i’m not contributing to my savings other than that and the 401k.   sometimes i think about moving to a 2 bed and getting a roommate, that would be more comfortable. good luck. you should be able to make that work depending on how much other debt you have. in 2011, i paid $1550 for a studio on a $57,000 income and made it work, but i had low student loans because of large grants during undergrad. you can make the payment. getting approved will be the hard part. it’s doable, depending on your lifestyle, may need to cut back on things. but there’s plenty of free stuff happenings/events in nyc so take advantage of those! i think so! i make just under $60k and pay $1650 in rent (+utilities), and i still go out for dinner, see broadway shows, take one international 2-week vacation a year, and max out my roth ira without accumulating credit card debt. (but i have minimal student debt.) i pay $1600 for rent on a $50k/y salary. i really have to budget. if i can do it, you sure can. it’s possible. i make 60k, pay $1600-2000 a month depending on my partners job and have savings. you'll be fine i can’t fathom this (or any of the other comments) tbh, i make 78k and pay $700 for a room with roomies. my wiggle room for my own place would be 1800 max, and that’s pushing it.   if i were you i would’ve busted my ass looking for roomies, but it’s too late now unless you would sublet your place to someone else. hey ! don’t know what’s deducted from your check but you and i make the same salary so one biweekly check should cover that ! try to save up your rent money for 6 months and toss the money into a hys account and don’t touch it ! that’s how i keep up with my rent -put the money aside and use it only for rent. it will be sorta uncomfortable and you won’t be saving much, but is it *possible*? yeah, of course. it’ll just be a matter of budgeting your expenses. you likely won’t be investing which is the major bummer. but if you need to do it for the time being, you will make it work.  time can seem daunting when there’s a whole lot of it in front of us. try to focus on right here, right now and what you can do today to put yourself in better shape for tomorrow. one step at a time. it’s when we see so much time in front of us and think about the collective of it all that we get overwhelmed and shut down. give yourself grace, and remind yourself that while it may not end up being your favorite year, you are absolutely going to be okay. you are in a position that is far above a position many others have found themselves in and *they* still skated by just fine.   be kind to yourself. it’s the most important thing we can do in this world. right alongside being kind to others :) 2100*40 = 84k min salary to get approved for $2100 rent  if you’re already in that spot, it’s technically doable, but it’s not advisable and you will not be saving any money. what’s the plan if there’s a rent increase? because you will most likely not be able to afford the apartment anymore if you’re still making 78k and that happens you can always break the lease. tell the landlord you got a pay cut and can't pay the full amount comfortably anymore and see what they say, ask if you can break the lease. most would rather work with you then risk a potential drawn out eviction     that said i think it will be doable as long as you're ok not saving for the year look into budgeting apps! it helps me so much when trying to allocate money and that way i can plan better for wanting to do a dinner out. rather than live in paranoia (i’m still paranoid tho bc it’s rough out here) depends on your debt, but it would be fine if there is no debt its possible but you will be cutting out alot of unecessry things like streaming. but if watching shows means that much to you can sail the high seas or look for bundle pacakages . look on the bright side- if you’re working a weekend job, you have much less time to spend the money!  focus on the little ways you can be frugal- a walk in the park with friends instead of cocktails, seek out sales and coupons for food, if there is free food at work, take extra and eat it for lunch/dinner. you’ll get by. of course you can, as long as you dont have any crippling debt, it is very possible. 2100 is only about $25000/year. you still have roughy 40k depending on how much tax u pay like you mentioned before i think you should create a budget to evaluate what are your needs and wants. for example, i live in nyc and don’t need to use my data often, as wi-fi can often be found out in public areas. i use ultra mobile, and i chose the $20 option for monthly coverage. in addition to this, i realized they had an annual plan for i think $187, which i eventually decided to take thereby, saving me some more money. don’t neglect your health though, 7 days a week is awful on the mind and body. if you prioritize the rent and bills, absolutely. then from there focus on either savings/investments, or self-spending. you can absolutely do it. when i was making 73k my monthly take home was around 3.8-4k and that was with hsa + 401k contributions and pre tax commuter plan. it really depends on your other monthly expenses and how many of them you have.   that rent would be about 37-ish percent of your gross annual earnings so right but not catastrophic. it depends on your other bills. do you have a car payment? do you have insurance payments? do you have school loans ect or debt outside of your normal bills you’re catching up on? if you don’t have a lot of extra bills it’s absolutely doable you just need to make a proper budget and stick to it. yeah yes but no eating out more than like 5x a month lol i hate these “can i afford it” questions because we don’t have any information to base it off of. we don’t know what other bills you have. if you have a $1000 car payment then no you can’t afford it. do you have zero debt, then yes you can probably afford it. i pay $1600 on $72k a year, i think you’ll be fine with careful budgeting. i usually have the rent taken out of my check twice a month (half and half payments) that goes to a separate account. i don’t trust myself enough to take it out without spending it first. your 40x calculation is: 84,000  you can do this but it’ll be very, very tight. get a roommate and make sure you spend on making it a habitable environment. you will be super stressed out but take it one day at a time.   it takes at least 6-12 months to be brought in front of a judge in ny and you can owe up until the court date, pay on the date, & have the clock reset on any eviction proceedings. make sure you know your rights as a tenant! honestly the best financial move would have been to get a roommate or move in with one until you feel comfortable enough and work on finding a job that gets you back to baseline pay. you’re a little over the 40x the rent rule but if you’re not dealing with other payments you should be fine. that’s like 4.6k take home a month, so 2.5k for expenses a month or $83 a day. if you can budget for that then yes. sorry about the tough situation, it’s hell out there right now girl, $2100/month to live in the ghetto? i once paid half that on a 3rd of the salary for a few years. no debt. no real savings during that time. very basic living and smart spending. i lived in bedstuy near you and had a similar income situation ($75k annually + weekend job paying $1600 a month) and i lived paycheck to paycheck paying $2500-2600 in rent and utilities. it's doable! yes, you can do it. focus on getting a promotion if you can and it will get easier. possible but risky it’s tricky but definitely doable! as long as you can get on the lease since you’re under the 40x rent requirements.  it sucks that you’re dealing with the hardships of the new job and having to scramble… but you sound intelligent and like you have a good understanding of what you have to do! you got this! you’ll find something better lol @ tight but doable. $60k would be tight but doable. i was doing that last year, same exact numbers. cooked at home, didn’t travel too much, and only invested money in my work 401k up to the match. was my budget tight? definitely.   now i got bumped to 100k and can breath 😂 i'm paying $2500 on a $71k salary. sucks, but raise coming next month. worth it to live alone! absolutely doable! if i remember correctly, at one point i was making exactly the same amount of money and paying the same amount in rent. it is 100% doable but you absolutely have to prioritize your spending when essentially half your take home pay is going towards rent.  you sound like a very intelligent individual and i’m sure i’m preaching to the choir here, but my advice is to do up a budget with your new expected income and monthly recurring expenses asap! start with your bills - rent, utilities, loans/debt payments, medical, and transportation costs to/from work, from there you can work in a budget for groceries & hygiene essentials and then you’ll arrive at what you have left to save and play with.  real talk: it’s gonna suck having your lifestyle take such a hit right now, but what’s better motivation than knowing the life you’ve lived before and wanting to get back to it? yup just won’t be able to save. i make $65k and afford $1750/mo just barely being as thrifty as possible while still having fun the job market is plentiful. we have an apartment near soho we visit sometimes and only pay 8k a month. 2 bedrooms. it all depends on your location in my opinion the second job doesn’t seem worth the roi and potential burnout / effect on your primary income. highly recommend a budget tracker! i found a really good one on etsy for $1 and love it. truly helps keep in line month to month you’re still below the recommended 30% of income on rent wayy more people are doing this than care to admit! you’ll be fine don’t worry totally doable. even leaves room for savings if you’re not into living extravagantly. or leaves room to live room to live (a little) large if you’re not into saving. yes can you negotiate with the landlord? sound very tight and difficult. keep looking for another job. and don’t quit the one you have till you find it nope. definitely, i make 65k a year and my rent is 300$ cheaper. i figured out the key to life is to not have any debt! i paid off my debt and my only bills is 1800$ rent and the other small expenses. i make 5k a month, i end up saving a good 1.5-3k a month depending if i fuck around or work ot. you can def make it! i make $75k. $2000 rent. still traveling, paying utilities, going out sometimes. still making contributions to 401k. i don’t know how to budget correctly, but i do manage my money well. all these comments are funny to me because so many actors (like myself) clear like $50-60k and pay $1800+ because living with roommates in your 30s is just not it. savings, who’s she? i pay 2k on 75k and i’m fine. not too much going to savings (aside from my 401k) and have to be mindful about spending but i’m not too stressed about it honestly i’m paying $2250 and my income is $70,000 so completely possible to do it you said you're playing catch up on bills, lowered starting salary, and now a $2100 rent. eh.. don't let lifestyle creep get you just breathe it's all going to work out, take baby steps and be around people that support and believe in you.   don't be scared of opening a simple excel sheet and budget out roughly your next 1 year if mathematically there js a way out it's all about following through. look at your last one year and don't be too strict with the budget make it easy to follow and one that does not depress you. it seems hard but if you can mentally map out where it's headed jt doesn't become a burden. coming from someone that was always scared and still is about money that helps.  read the book broke millennial tooo as a side read gave me comfort.  lastly think about a roommate and a cheaper area as you go forward. it’s definitely doable but you’ll really need to budget it out for yourself to see if it’s doable for you.  i could make that rent work on less income, but i’m pretty strict with budgeting and i don’t have any outstanding debts, chronic medical issues, etc.    outside of that, being in a bad financial spot is awful and it really puts you in a bad space mentally.  trust me i know. but with that said i think that you can make this work. make more you time in your free time instead of going out fun time. walks in the park, meditation, free yoga at home, reading, free streaming sites and services, or cheap meet ups with friends like coffee as opposed to dinner out.  life will be different for a bit but don’t let it get you too down. different doesn’t have to be bad. sometimes different can be good too, but just in a different way. you still have 52k left. what are you talking about? what did you do with all that money when you made 120k and had 92k left? come on, this is bs oh man, i’m in your exact previous situation, but i just haven’t gotten the job yet. thought i would get a job right away too. even going down to 90k is something i’m having to wrap my head around and its been really difficult. if i do have to take a hit to around where you’re at, at least i know from responses that i would be able to handle like a $1700 apartment maybe. i i am currently subbing in brooklyn because i had to leave my apartment in may. it's absolutely possible.  most have to live below their means and don't wanna give up certain 'luxuries', but the way the market and inflation is now, nah, you can't live like it's 2014 in 2024.  make a budget, see where ya money is going.  the going out, shopping, stupid debt (klarna, affirm, etc) all of that has to go.  once you find a happy medium, you'll see that 2.1 isn't all that bad.  i promise, great luck! it’s very possible. some people here make it seem like you’ll be living off top ramen. not true—you’ll be just fine stay away from owning a car and it’s not only possible, but common sounds easy tbh . i live in nyc and there has been a couple times where rent was half my monthly check . i don't understand why people find it hard . just budget and you'll be fine i did that in 2019! it’s doable but you have to be disciplined. if you have to work weekends to pay your rent, maybe better to move to somewhere where you pay less, but have more time 80k and pay 1,850 it’s more than doable. i also have loans and other expenses. the thing that kills a lot of us is debt service. if you have little debt, it's easier.  if you're paying 5 or 6 hundred a month because you were using credit cards to pay for essentials, you're looking at a tough situation.    ex. i'd be fine if it wasn't paying 850 a month on just debt. i think it depends on the big picture, including other expenses. that’s about what i make and live in a rent-stabilized studio for $1550. my monthly debt payments (mostly student loans and medical debt, god bless america) are around $600. i’m lucky to have very good health insurance now with low co-pays, otherwise i don’t think i could do it. i get by ok as it is but not enough to save much or travel far. in short: yes, maybe, depending. yes for sure you can definitely do it! yeah you might have to make a few adjustments but it’s more than doable yes last year i was making 80k and paying 2,100 per month in rent. it was tight but definitely doable! 100% as long as you’re not spending a ton of money sounds like too high of a rent tbh i can relate to op.  i was working 2 jobs made 120k,  took a promotion on one of my jobs that started pay at 80k for the first year while leaving my other job.  my mortgage and my condo maintenance all together comes to around 2400$.  granted i do have money stacked for a rainy day i didn’t want to delve into that too much so yea with buying groceries, going out every so often, gas, car/home owners insurance, electric, other bills, i was still able to put aside about 500 or so a month. yes. [removed] i make 45k and my rent is 2600. it works lmao, gotta love the mcdonalds meal deal hi, i came across this post via search query yesterday (casual lurker here) and felt the need to log on to comment. 31f single in astoria, i earn $82k base pay (pre-tax, 401k, other withholdings) with a modest commission structure. i currently pay $1995/month in rent at present, which will increase to $2070/month on october 1.   in short: yes, it is perfectly possible to do. i don’t have new clothes, i choose to pay for quality produce/food, and vacations for me are in the us now and for short stretches.   it is feasible, albeit not ideal. i still set aside to save for future, but last year i saved $10k in cash (not 401k) and had absolutely no life. i didn’t manage to save at all aside from commission payouts this year due to some depression tbh.   i applaud you, op, you not only found another job in a bad market but you maintained a good relationship with your former landlord. if i was in your shoes, i would take this next year to rebuild and understand your lifestyle will temporarily be affected. you sound like you are bad at handling money so you might be cooked maybe cut on the avocado toast? nope",143,170,positive,0.5075879096984863,313,i made 77k and paid $1950 in rent. it was doable. i make 77k and pay $1950 in rent. it was do-able. i make 77k and pay $1950 in rent. it was do-able. i make 77k and pay $1950 in rent. it was do-able. i make 77k and pay $1950. i make 77k and pay $1950.
125,NYC should do this like right now…,"100%. algorithms running up everyone's rent just because one place did, is insane. it helps no one. this affected middle america much more than a super popular city like nyc. case in point: every time a bidding war starts the algorithm was wrong.    the feds are investigating real page for sharing secret info (asking rent isn’t secret): vacancy rates. again, for nyc it’s generally known - the government itself releases those numbers according to surveys they do   there are 2 directions this city can go. dumb people can keep outbidding each other over the shitty existing stock. or freeze rents almost completely and people will move out very rarely   in both of these cases there are for example 500,000 apartments and 2,000,000 households who want to live in them. at the end of the day 1,500,000 households will be disappointed for one reason or another i think the more fundamental problem needs to be addressed. no matter how much we dabble with rent control and other measures, we cannot make rents affordable without allowing housing supply to meet the demand. currently zoning designed to prop up real estate values simply criminalize dense housing that we desperately need.  we need more housing to fix the housing crisis. while this ban may help a little bit, but it's just a bandaid and not the solution that gets at the root of the problem. this is awesome. the free market only works when there isn’t collusion. like seriously? like are you furreal? san francisco is a case study in what not to do. this just isn’t a factor in nyc",144,30,negative,0.7332043051719666,174,this is awesome. the free market only works when there isn’t collusion. this is awesome. the free market only works when there isn’t collusion. this just isn’t a factor in nyc. this just isn’t a factor in san francisco. this just isn’t a factor in san francisco. this is awesome. this is awesome. this is awesome. this

128,What % of your take home do you pay in rent? ,"40% 90% 16% gross and roughly 27% net, living by myself in a studio in brooklyn like 38% single 40% of net with 2 roommates! 45% of net (after retirement contributions, taxes, etc) and single 10% of gross. wow. i’ve never calculated it that way before. single, two bedroom. 60% of take home (after tax and other deductions) honestly, most responses were a lot better than expected. but then again, there's probably a hidden selection bias here, i.e., people who are willing to comment tend to be in a better financial standing. 40-45 net, single ues 25 percent, after taxes, benefits and maxing 401k + fsa.   13 percent gross. single. but this isn't a good sanity check for people. if your single and high income your rent doesn't go up linearly with income.  a lot of high income workers in their 20s live scrappy and have roomates. so their rents are going to be completely below.  i'd say your being financially responsible if you can put 15 percent into your retirement and save 10 percent after rent. if you can do better than that, you should. but the percentage of income someone who makes 70 to 120k a year is going to differ from people making 150 to 300k a year and people making 300 to 500k a year.  their circumstances are just different.  this city is a place where you have all these people sometimes living next to each other.

130,What do you think the city should do about landlords hoarding rent stabilized apts?,"tax them. don't we need money? that's why i never take nyc politicians seriously because you need money and you have people sitting on inventory which leads to a tax write off. let them fix them up and make them habitable again so they can rent them? let them divide that cost say over 5 years and whatever the current interest rate is and add that to the rent?  the issue that leads to hoarding is that landlords cannot rent them out in the current fashion they are in (e.g. they require substantial repairs), however the cost of repairing them and bringing them up to code is way higher than the rent increases they are allowed to raise.   it's really basic math, if the cost of the repairs is less than the rent over the same period, its a losing battle. wonder how this is going to be received, but here goes nothing.   if you want landlords to stop keeping rs units off the market, the state needs to amend the portion of the 2019 rent stabilization law that dictates how much landlords can recoup from renovating rent stabilized apartments.   my friend’s building in midtown west had a rs apartment studio that a tenant lived in for 30+ years, paying well below $1k. i saw the apartment after the tenant moved out and it literally looked like a bomb had gone off. it was bad.    don’t quote me on the numbers, but the landlord said it would take around 40k-50k to do a full gut reno and get the apartment back to code. after investing that into the unit, the 2019 rs law would only allow the rent to be raised to maybe $1.1k.    the tenant vacated that apartment in early 2020. it’s still sitting empty today.   i had been in nyc real estate for ~10 years at the time and had seen rs leases were landlords justify a rent increase on a rs apartment - new boiler, updates to the elevator, new electric etc…+ how long the apartment had been empty.   all those calculations that got them a decent return on their investment was out the window in 2019 and some landlords feel they wouldn’t see their investment back when renovating. some landlords continue to illegally deregulate apartments (definitely a thing before 2019) as well.   one could argue that the landlord should have kept the apartment up to code over the duration of the tenant’s actual lease and this problem wouldn’t exist, and i’d agree.   regarding taxes/fines, look at some of the landlords sued by the state for housing discrimination (not accepting vouchers) and having to pay 50k-200k+ per infraction. and those same landlords are still doing it today. they don’t care. i think goldfarb (who has around 6000 units) has been sued and fined at least 3 times since 2014. a case from 2018 settled last year for a total fine of just under $1,000,000 (https://fairhousingjustice.org/enforcement/fhjc-wins-federal-trial-against-goldfarb-properties/#:~:text=the%20court%20also%20ordered%20goldfarb,with%20rental%20subsidies%20or%20vouchers)   fines are a minor inconvenience of doing business. the same way that a landlords calculates a building’s vacancy rate when looking at its cap rate.   if the state levied a tax/fine of some sort, i’m sure the landlords would simply do a calculation on how many rs apartments they have sitting empty, how much it would cost to renovate all of them, when they’d expect their investment back, the increase in utilities (water, oil, trash removal) they’d be paying for the occupied apartments versus the amount of fine/tax and i’m sure there’s a good few that would pay the fine and move on as if nothing happened.   the only solution to any of this is for the city to build more housing. almost anything else is a bandaid. honestly banning tenant-facing broker fees(like literally every other american city in human history ever) would make me moderately more amendable to changes to rs apartments. it just feels like new yorker landlords want their cake and to eat it too what’s the point of hoarding them? how does it benefit landlords? nothing happens in a silo.  pass rent regulations for all units!  and stop acting like treating market rate apartments like the stock exchange is reasonable.  everyone deserves to be able to afford rent without needing to be nomadic!    in california there’s a limit to how much a landlord can increase a market rate apartment.  extend the rent controlled rental increase policies to all units.  that will help make all increases less volatile.  a lot of the perceived loss of rent comes from the fact that so many market rate units are being set at unreasonable prices creating large amounts of turn over.  nullifying the law making it illegal to require a renter to pay a broker’s fee was stupid.  the current system incentivizes turn over.    it’s not normal or healthy for a person to need to move once a year because they received a 20% rental increase on a market rate apartment because they couldn’t (1) didn’t qualify for an income capped unit (2) couldn’t locate a rent stabilized or controlled unit or (3) found a rent stabilized or controls unit but couldn’t afford the unreasonable brokers fee. i have lived in a stabilized building for 25 years and the owners are using every loop hole in the system to take units out of stabilization.  for example, combining two units into one, and making deals with temporary tenants to charge them a discounted rate if they allow them to change the paperwork with the city. there aren't so many of them that it's a real problem. you hear about it because the landlord lobby wants to end rent stabilization. claim imminent domain and take the properties. if anyone complains, say you’re building a pipeline - people seem okay with imminent domain for pipelines. idk, but it really is pretty nuts. it’s almost like there is some form of corruption keeping things this way. there was a program to retrofit basement apartments in outer boroughs by granting homeowners money to build apartments, it’s a waste.  it only provides one apartment at a time.    the city ought to be giving those grants to landlords who own these stabilized buildings that can’t get them up to code while turning a profit. my landlord is admittedly sitting on a vacant rent stabilized apartment, and waiting for the tenant nextdoor to die so they can be combined into a 2-3 br. they've already done it to 2 other floors. will somebody explain (without calling people stupid or other degrading names) why we cant just have one property tax rate scale for occupied apartments, one for unoccupied apartments that are habitable, and one for ones that are proven inhabitable/being upgraded?  divide by portion of the year, and that’s the property tax with an incentive to rent/punishment for failure to find a renter, and it seems fair because it gives ll a chance to prove their apartment isnt habitable so they arent punished for improvements. throw in a 15 day grace period or something like that between renters, and thats a healthy incentive structure thag addresses both the need to move fast, the city’s need for more tax revenue, and ll’s desire to have a level of control over their tax liability home vacancy tax. like toronto did. you’re assuming the units that haven’t been used in a decade or more actually match up with the 5,000 landlord / renter laws in this city    so say there are some things that would be considered 311 violations if rented. and it costs tens of thousands of dollars to bring up to renter code (very different than the certificate of habitability) how would the city force a landlord to spend $30k and then ask for $1800 rent. you would have to add another step of actually raising the rent to <cost of bringing up to renter requirements> / 12 or something. and i don’t know if you’ve seen renovation costs in nyc post covid, it’s double or triple what it used to be    this is similar to the ubereats laws, you can’t really win and there will always be more loopholes. i’m forced to rent this unit? i smell gas, let’s call coned and they’ll close the line for 14 months. can’t rent it, sorry. i don’t have money to fix the heating system that isn’t working, i’ll put it up for sale rs is unsustainable as it currently is. overall, it’s profitable as a whole for rs landlords, but the profit margins are decreasing every year. there’s only so long that can continue for.   i think if rs is to continue, rents need to be based on the minimum profit margins needed for rs landlords to stay in business, not some utopian idea that the rent should never go up. you can’t force people to operate failing businesses. vacancy tax. it’s your fault you bought property and didn’t bring it up to code over time. i think it would be interesting to make it more the norm to have the tenant update a stabilized unit every year they live in it so that it is up to code/currant standard of habitability. in many apartments in germany people are expected to buy most of a/a whole kitchen for their apartment. if you moved into a stabilized unit and knew up front you were expected to buy xyz and make sure everything was kept up dated so it didn’t fall into disrepair would you still go for it in exchange for lower rent?   one of the reasons so many stabilized places are off market is because they’re uninhabitable because the previous tenants lived there for so long. it wasn’t worth it to those tenants to update because of the rules that renovation = landlord allowed to raise the rent. the problem is now that those people are gone it’s not worth it for the landlord to do any updates when they know they won’t get their money back for that for a very long time. if a landlord said i could move into a stabilized place for the current stabilized price in exchange for paying for the renovation and keeping the place up to code i’d go for it if i thought i was staying in nyc for a long time.   i have no clue the logistics of making any of that work, if it even could, but i think it would be a decent compromise. tenant gets a stabilized unit that’s less expensive than average units and doesn’t have to worry about rent going up like crazy, landlord won’t have to worry about paying to update and will just be making money off the new tenant. i’m sure i’ll see the argument that it’s not worth it for a tenant to do since they don’t own the place and are only adding value for the landlord, but as someone who has no plans to ever leave manhattan and can’t see ever affording to own property it would be worth it to me! if they hold apartment stock this means other landlords are getting rent sooner. this is optimal. it all evens out. if landlords are colluding, this is wrong and there's laws against that. but if they're just deciding not to rent there is nothing you can do. it's to their detriment in the long run. mao had some incredible ideas about this you are so right. they should be mandated by law to release the apartments to working poor and lower end middle class within 90 days of the apartment becoming vacant. they should be fully renovated and if not the landlord and building manager face immediate minimum sentences of 6 month for every incident and fines. i’ve been under the impression that landlords were given tax breaks etc for turning units into rent stabilized ones. if that’s not the case please let me know. if that is correct, it sounds like they don’t want to incur the cost, despite previously reaping the benefits. it’s very simple math: if taxes and maintenance cost more than the rent, it’s not worth losing money renting it to someone.   we need to destabilize the $500-$1800 units to motivate the landlords to renovate and rent them at market rate.  the flood of new units on the market will lower prices citywide a lot better than 10,000 warehoused $600 apartments that never go on the market will. they will also generate a lot of tax revenue. let me give you a scenario. i have a rent stabilized building. a tenant moved in a year ago and a month after they moved in was taking a shower. he noticed the water wasn’t draining (found out after the strainer was clogged with his long hair) and decided to just keep on showering until the water was 6” deep and water made its way out through a cracked piece of grout in the wall 4-5” above the floor. he destroyed 2 bathrooms underneath him, a kitchen and half a store in the ground floor. he caused about 15k in damages. he pays $800 a month in rent.   now tell me why we’re not allowed to keep rent stabilized apartments off the market if we want to? where are these apartments? the housing and vacancy survey just came out the other day and shows we have the lowest vacancy rate since 1968.   there is no huge stock of empty rent stabilized apartments. becasue it costs more money to occupy a rent stabilized unit than the money you get from it, nor can you recoup the cost of renovating the unit by increasing the rent due to the current laws. auditing is not going to do anything, if you tax them, all the investors will just leave the city, which is bad for everyone if all investor money exits nyc. people will downvote this, but this is the reason why they keep them vacant. are we talking about the $8 - 18k in tax that each vacant unit in nyc already pays? i.e pro rata share of building’s re tax bill. any tax breaks they currently enjoy should be cancelled. an audit should be made annually when the assessments are made for taxes. more than 1% of 1000 apt's should be cause for a phase out of tax breaks. vacancy taxes in general are needed. keep your rental in livable and updated condition at a fair price so people actually want to live there. if it sits empty, you pay! they should have to pay an additional 1% in property taxes on every vacant unit. tar and feather guillotine build more housing? if they are really hoarding it, just build more and the city will become rich via property tax. maybe fix the laws so it is profitable for them to be returned to market?  does anyone really want to move into an antiquated apartment with squeaky floors, old electrical (like no overhead lights, switched outlets, no ac outlet), bad plumbing fixtures for mixing water temps and slow drains (no dw don't even dream of w/d)?  or are you okay to pay more for something that is modernized? landlords need to prove they are advertising the apartment+that it's in livable condition. they get a month grace period before receiving a fine. the fine would be equivalent to 1 month's rent.   i think that should be enough. no landlord would intentionally hold apartments vacant that they could be making money on, the issue is they don’t think they can make money because the costs of renovating and maintaining the units to keep them livable and up to code outweigh the rent they’d collect. the solution would be to incentivize landlords either by allowing them to raise rents or subsidizing renovations so they can fix units without incurring as much of a cost. a third option would be taxing them until keeping them vacant costs more than renting them but eventually there won’t be any incentive for investors to put money into housing in the city if it keeps getting costlier and costlier and the roi shrinks they need to pay a penalty for every apartment that doesn’t have a resident i don’t have the link, but aren’t apartment vacancies at historic lows? something like 1.4% most of those vacancies are on apartments that need repairs.  the city should pay for the repairs but the landlord can only collect the rent it was previously. renters get fixed apartments and landlords don’t have to pay for repairs and as a result cannot charge market rate but only the stabilized rate it was at before. end rent stabilization completely, all it does is picks winners and losers. mao them",136,219,negative,0.6242544054985046,355,"why?

(example: athlete's village co-op in vancouver) * market stability: abundant non-market housing keeps private sector rents in check. (example: vienna, austria)  **cons:**  * accessibility: high demand leads to long waiting lists. (example: 6-year wait in hong kong) * funding hurdles: government support is crucial but often inconsistent. (example: canada's two-decade funding gap)  **conclusion:** non-market housing offers promise, but it's not a magic solution. careful consideration of its benefits and drawbacks is crucial before implementation.  &#x200b;  shout out to bard for the concise summary of the video is this a graph for all of ny or specifically nyc? and if it is nyc, is it representative of all 5 boroughs or just manhattan?   the challenge is where is it that the building is meant to happen? what's the zoning?  what's already there? if it's an empty block, what can and cannot be built there? how much is whatever one builds going to cost just to build it? what are the neighbors going to say? what is the community board going to say?  nyc couldn't even put up a giant ferris wheel in staten island next to the ferry terminal because of red tape when practically every other major cosmopolitan city has one. the problem isn't lack of desire. it's how much is it going to cost and who is going to fight the development every step of the way. i’m just here for the fred appreciation, the economist in me feels seen 😌 rand has a policy brief and research reports that came out a few months ago on what policies would be best for nyc housing supply. rand is a highly  respected economics think tank that is paid attention to be policy experts. you guys can read about it here:      [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research\_reports/rra2775-1.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rra2775-1.html) there it is mitchell lama 2.0 - https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/nyregion/housing-crisis-new-york-senate-mitchell-lama.html i'm not sure why people are surprised there are fewer builds.   another fun fact: nyc has the most strict rent control policies in the nation. if i were a developer, i wouldn't build a single unit in nyc since i'll be losing money to rent stabilization.   there has to be profits for there to be more houses. i am sorry to bring this bad news but there's no profits to be made in building housing in nyc. rent stabilized units barely sell for half of their sold values pre-2019, when rs laws went into effect. imagine houses selling for half of their sale values of 2018 in 2024.    only in nyc! go to your local community board (they do zoom now) and testify in favor of all new housing and upzoning in your area. #openny private builders know to stay away from nyc. too many 'green' rules make apartments undesirable for sane renters. electric heat & stoves guarantee massive electric bills for the suckers who rent them. these are ny state data, nyc likely looks even worse.  if only we have economists to tell us how to solve this problem (hint: not with price control).",138,55,neutral,0.5356488227844238,193,"'green' rules make apartments undesirable for sane renters. electric heat & stoves guarantee massive electric bills for the suckers who rent them. these are nyc rules, not a solution. i'm not a developer, but i'm a firm believer that we need more housing . i'm not sure why people are surprised there are fewer builds. i'm just saying i think"

my landlord didn't return my security deposit for over a month before. just empty promises of ""we will get it to you"". they didn't give it to me until i started threatening to sue not an attorney either, but i am an agent and we have are required to do  continuing education to renew our license every 2 years and one of the required classes we have to do all the time is new legal matters. i guarantee you that the 9nly things a ll can keep any portion of your deposit for is damage that is more than normal wear and tear and anything to return the apartment to the condition it was when it was first rented, including repainting to its original.color if it was painted without permissi8n to something else, and removal of anything left behind that wasn't already there when you moved in. using the security deposit as last month's rent is not allowed. the ll threatening to keep it because you didn't g8ve them enough notice that you weren't renewing is not allowed. don't let em fool you is any of this information relevant for the state of nj?

  i left the country a few days after my lease expired because of a family emergency and it will most likely be another year before i'm back in nyc.   my management claims the only way of getting my deposit back is mailing a physical check, and i don't have a us address at the moment.   it seems kinda odd but i'm not sure if there is anything legally wrong about it, couldn't find any information in the document above. thank you so much - i am dealing with this now but i’m wondering, what were to happen if hypothetically, i file now (almost one month since i was owed the deposit), and then the landlord pays me back my deposit in some days or weeks. the law was broken but i would hypothetically have been paid - late. does this still hold in court? [deleted] hi op thank you for the info, just a quick question, what is considered damages? we didn't get out itemized receipt till after 14 days and our ll won't send us the full deposit. how much can we use for them? what is the interest rate as mentioned in the post? our security deposit was 5950 is there a statute of limitations on this? anyone else have the same issue but with a move in deposit?  wondering if similar laws apply. we had to pay a $1k deposit before moving in, it’s been almost 6 months and the ll/management company still hasn’t returned it after multiple requests. fun question just for funsies. tomorrow will be my 14-days since move out on 8/31. our landlord did send us an email with what he claims are the damages, but has not sent us an itemized list of deductions. per the above, if he doesn’t send us that list, he forfeits the right to retain any of the deposit.   however, my roommate and i went our separate ways at the end of this lease, and i moved into a 1br under the same management/with the same landlord. i worry this puts me in a tricky / risky situation where my landlord will retaliate against me in some way for asserting this right to the full deposit.   any advice for this circumstance? feels like just a bummer situation :| hi! thank you for posting this, i had a quick question about the amount of damages. my landlord failed to return my security deposit within 14 days, they in fact never reached out till i reached out a month after move-out date. i sued in small claims and have a court date in jan 2025. they have reached out now finally offering to return the full amount. what are the odds that i will be able to win for damages as well in addition to just the security deposit if i take them to small claims? what will i need to show? do you sue in the borough that the apartment is in or the borough that the landlord lives in?  and thank you for the helpful post! ny state has the longest time for returning the deposit. i believe the exact wording is: ""within 30 to 60 days"". recovery actions can begin in 30 days, but even if successful will take 60 days to legally recover. some percentage of tenants will not even be around in 30 to 60 days, or won't have the energy, know-how, or wherewithal to sue. the others who do sue and win still give the landlord a 60 day float on those funds, which can be quite valuable in the case of pressing mortgage deadlines, etc. that is the landlord game. the tenant game is to have arrears equaling the deposit before vacating.",137,60,neutral,0.5228701233863831,197,"vacated the premises. she did not receive the return of her security deposit or an itemized list of the deductions from the security deposit within fourteen days from the date on which she vacated the premises as required by new york general obligations law section 7-108, 1-a (e). if a landlord fails to return a security deposit and/or provide an itemized list of deductions from the security deposit within fourteen days from the date on which the tenant"

(all mom&pop landlord) just post it on streeteasy yourself wtf lowballing you here but if you’d take $3k, one of my best friends & her fiancée are looking for a place! otherwise: yeah, craigslist is tough with nicer apartments because the craigslist crowd tends to want a “deal.” i think the listing is aok, the photos are fine. if you can add a floor plan that would be great. perhaps a link to a video that you post on youtube.   in terms of renting a co-op, most people coming to nyc are not all that familiar with the co-op process, so you need to be about to clearly explain the advantages and the requirements. i find that it just takes talking to a lot of people. also the market really will pick up in the next week or two.   best of luck, suzanne  (i send a chat request if you have any additional questions.) i actually used it last year when i was apt hunting at the suggestion of my manager and two quality apartments ended up being on the shortlist for me (one i am living in rn).  i was looking for a space that came with a roommate tho! do you have cheaper apartments available? can we please bring craigslist back?!  facebook marketplace is awful.  can you post on streeteasy without going through a broker? zillow is free for owners i’ll take for 2800 :) i have a rental property in la 700sqft on westside for 2750 - but moving east, much higher rents in nyc! avail add stick it notes with your phone number and a date to the photo. most posts are bs on cl these days. i found an incredible apt on craigslist (current one) and what had me confident it was real was the photos being of kinda bad quality yet consistent.   had i seen a post it note with a date and some sort of way to contact on the other listings photos i thought were bs, i might have followed up with those  this is all assuming cl allows stuff like the post it notes with context info in all the photos. if i saw a post where someone who lived in ny spelled times square wrong, and said “basic nyc standard norm”, i would think they’re probably a scammer god bless people like you. found my landlord in boston craigslist. she was just looking for someone who would take care of the place and pay rent on time. she certainly got that with me. i was looking to avoid the broker fee. things have worked out great and we are going on 5 years damn i would’ve taken this, just signed unfortunately legit people can't even keep a post on craigslist.   i was helping someone post, and it kept getting flagged and taken down. use fb marketplace for a free option while furnished apartments could be of help for some people, who can spend 4000$ monthly on an apartment, is most likely not looking for the most generic, randomly placed furniture — no offense, maybe it just needs to be organized a bit better and get better photos.   offer it non furnished for x, and “possibility of being furnished” for x+very small y, and try to provide photos with no furniture as well even if you just move everything behind the camera for 5 minutes send me your listing! this is my ideal scenario, and i am apartment searching in ny. there is a lot to sort through on craigslist, but i still use it. craigslist isn’t moderated and is frustrating to search with. i assume that 4/5 listings i see on there are no longer available by the time i reach out so it feels like a bad use of my time. same goes for facebook. we only listed on zillow and found a good tenant. but that was only once back in 2021. the tenant came with a real estate agent and then asked for our phone number and then we signed a lease. i really like your website. i love the color layout and the way it is organized. overall, i think it is good. it's nice to see a real person posting on craigslist but that listing is extremely unaffordable for me. that's probably the most likely reason you're not getting inquiries. you are a great landlord taking care of this yourself! broker fees are the biggest scam this city has to offer. i’ve found all my apartments since moving here on craigslist - i’m not moving next until december or i would jump on this place. hopefully this post helps you with some traction and good luck getting it filled",136,112,negative,0.6526435613632202,248,and with scams. craigslist is overrun with scams. i stopped using it to search. craigslist is with scams. has been overrun withd with scams. has been overrun with scams. has been littered with scams. has been overrun with students and recent graduates. has been

137,50% broker’s fee???,"it's insane and i would also operate under the assumption that the broker is lying to you if they say somebody else is offering a 50% broker fre he’s lying. one month or max 15% would be my final offer because that is a decent price for a studio in nyc and you mentioned you would stay for a few years, so definitely could be worth it but 50% is outrageous who’s the broker? he's probably lying to you, but that info doesn't really help you. brokers are 100% scum, down to the last person. name and shame. if math done right that's a 8700.00 fee.    i guess question is how long do you plan on renting there?  1450 for any apt in nyc is a good deal. update: i just got word that the landlord and broker will be splitting the broker fee so theyll be choosing the highest bidder. this is so shitty i dont even know what to do he’s trying to scam people broker fees are not a bidding war. i would see if you can report him he’s bluffing im sorry why would a higher broker fee make you a more competitive applicant? the broker fee doesnt go to the landlord and the landlord is the one choosing the applicant are they not? this is insanely greedy and shady by the realtor to just make more money i would contact their broker.  that is ridiculous. yes, it’s insane. this person is trying to grift money out of you.   $1450/month sounds like a good deal. but if you stay for 2 years, then that broker fee pushes the net rent to $1812/month. over the same 2 years a typical 15% broker fee (still theft, but at least it’s what most people pay) yields a net rent of $1558.   another way of looking at it: if your budget is actually $1800, then you could rent a place for $1675/month and pay a 15% fee. that extra money goes to getting you a better place, not to some lazy broker. gross, broker fees are biggest crock of shit. you can find something without giving this guy 50% of a yearly rent. i’d block the number immediately and move on call the brokerage company he works for and report him. i searched the broker's name and found the name of the company he works for. it is a national company based in dc and is a subsidiary of a publicly traded company. i am sure they would love to know what is happening.  this is in addition to complaints to new york state, etc. there was a broker, ari wilford, the ny post exposed as charging too high brokers fees and eventually the state came down hard on him and his firm. could be worth messaging someone related to the original article. that’s got to be illegal. anyway to report this guy or their agency? don’t pay a brokers fee in the fall and this is just a game to get you to pay more than the nonexistent competitor lol. i’m currently going through some bullshit myself where the building i’m interested in just opened up about a week with no applications, tons of tours, completely vacant building.  i’m guessing the landlord has zero experience in renting in nyc because come november through february, no one’s lifting a finger to leave.  these landlords and brokers are ass lying scam! this has to be illegal. this person should be acting in the best interest of the landlord, not themselves. they can ask for a higher offer on rent but a higher broker’s fee? that’s especially crooked why would paying a higher brokers fee give you a better chance at an apt? it’s not like you’re offering  to pay more rent. is the broker also the landlord? or is this a straight up bribe for the broker to put your application at the top of the list? it’s a scam; sadly this is just how the new york apartment scene is right now i thought it wasn’t legal for the brokers fee to exceed 15%? broker is lying through his teeth i feel like this is getting out of hand and license should be revoked. i’ve been denied apartment applications because of this situation. i would take time out of my week to go to open houses and they simply won’t let you apply once someone gives them the highest offer asap! brokers are such sleazebags, high end is 15% but really it should be one months rent or like 7-10% criminal i would give him a 5 and a nod as a broker, let me just say, fuck this guy. so insane. it’s crazy to me how these brokers won’t even take the time to type out a grammatically correct text for you (see above) which is highly unprofessional, yet still have the audacity to suggest that their “professional” services are worth a 50% brokers fee! also, who says they have other applicants willing to pay over 50%? the broker does, that’s who. do not pay that. that seems highly questionable to allow bidding on a broker's fee. thought we didn't allow bribery around here?? lol average broker fee from my understanding is 1 months rent i would find someone else if you give me 100% i'll give you the apt i believe this is illegal they’ve done this before (same phone number) a couple months ago seemingly with the same unit (op said also a studio in fort greene) https://www.reddit.com/r/nycapartments/s/vwuaqiex7z the legal maxium is 15% that’s 6 months of rent nah!!! don't pay. scamming lol not even legal, definetely a scam or something  that is literally absurd , first time i hear something like that honestly, i wouldn’t pay more than 15%; 50% is a complete lie and he’s likely breaking the law by doing so i paid 2800 realtor fee for a 2 bedroom sucker born every minute. brokers gonna broker. 😂😂😂 50% fee to open this locked apartment door for you. take it or leave it. realtor? you can have my answer now, if you like. my final offer is this: nothing. not even the fee for the background check, which i would appreciate if you would put up personally. they are making it sound like a lottery. then they will notify everyone . once they receive the funds, you get blocked. how’s this even legal??? fucking grifting piece of shit, these people needs to be face consequences for these slimy shit i would not offer more than 15% just say no. the owner chooses the tenant, no? the broker fee should have no weight... offer to up the rent price a bit and lower the broker fee and make sure the landlord or property manager knows about the offer.... they are 1000% lying i’ve lived in nyc since i graduated from college in 2013, have lived in five apartments, have never paid $1 in brokers fees thats...deranged...also 7 days? lmfao this clown. hes either got no other offers or waiting for the best one. see if you can find the listing on another site, if its not exclusive you can work with another guy who wont be robbing you blind. correct, it’s insane   but it just doesn’t matter, *someone* is going to pay it; no matter how many people refuse to pay insane broker fees, someone else will always pay is it rent stabilized?  if so, can absolutely make sense. there’s no way this broker isn’t breaching their fiduciary duty by essentially asking for a bribe to take your application. welcome to nyc thats how it is and some even want broker fee equivalent to 1 months rent cost",136,129,negative,0.8355796337127686,265,"i’ve been denied apartment applications because of this situation i feel like this is getting out of hand and license should be revoked i’ve been denied apartment applications because of this situation i feel like this is getting out of hand and license should be revoked i feel like this is getting out of hand and brokers are such sleazebags, max 15% would be my final offer because that is a decent price for"

""livelihoods of thousands of brokers"".   anybody else have any sympathy for cancer? i don’t know why anyone besides brokers and landlords would oppose this. sure, landlords can just roll the costs into rent, but 1. it still reduces the up-front costs of moving, 2. rent prices are still subject to some supply/demand forces, so they probably won’t raise them 1:1 with current fee structures, which relates to 3. no way are landlords going to accept paying 12-15% of annual rent as a fee; they’ll force brokers to charge less or go without.  there’s no downside to making whoever hired the broker pay for their service. the problem is the developers and real estate companies have a heavy hand in politics, and always vote this down one place i checked out gave me a code to a lockbox in the front of building, inside were the keys to the unit. after viewing the unit alone i noticed a piece of paper taped to the inside of the units front door with a captcha code linking to the application. 15% brokers fee if accepted. “no one is saying you shouldn’t earn a living, we’re just looking at who’s paying for that,” said council member sandy nurse, co-chair of the body’s progressive caucus. “the fact is we have a situation where there’s people that we don’t need who are supposed to be doing work and we have to pay for their labor that we did not contract.”  doesn't get more simple than this california. we don’t do this and those fees aren’t baked in. it’s paid by the landlord and is seen as cost of business. you do need to compensate the broker for marketing and listing and contract negotiations. but new york is ridiculous putting it on the renter. the landlords with assets should pay it. the renting class is the next generation and needs to build wealth so why make our lives harder anyone who has doubts as to why this law is needed should read my thread with the broker below.  brokers are opposed to the bill because their entire enterprise relies upon coercion to extract profits. i’m pretty sure landlords in ny can write rental property related, including broker fees, off their taxes as an expense. while tenants can’t. that’s how it works in fl. so why tf tenants should pay it? they tried to ban the fees back around covid, but the brokers fought back. honestly this city is a joke, literally nowhere else in the country has these retarded broker’s fees. my wife and i were looking for a new place. i saw a sign on the side of the building that there were rooms available for rent.  i went in, asked the doorman / super if i could see it. it was still being renovated but i liked the location and could tell it would be good when finished after he let me in.   i did all the paper work and signed all the stuff with the company that held the property.   they still wanted a brokers fee even though we never interacted with a broker at any point. i showed the place to myself and did all the paperwork myself at the holding company.   absolutely stupid. the consumer always ends up paying. even if everything is “no fee” it’s amortize into the rent. thats why no fees are generally higher in price point. idk how i feel about this. i support it, but there must be something else in place where the landlord can’t jack up the rent!!  for example, i was looking at an apartment in kips bay recently and the broker said that he would do first months rent broker fee ($3500) or would have the rent be $3800.. so basically if i were to stay over a year, the rent would only go up from there. i would rather pay the fee and have the rent go up from $3500 vs $3800!! as someone who does not live in new york, but would if it didn't cost so much to move there, i have no doubt that the economy of the city would be better if there was greater freedom of movement into it and inside it here is the only thing i can say: this issue is not as simple as its being made out to be. unless you take into account how and why the entire industry practices the way it does, everyone, including myself, will be surprised by the second and third order consequences of new laws.

142,Don't Walk Into Leasing Offices with Brokers,"scumbag brokers as usual this almost happened to me but i circumvented it by calling the office myself and asking for a tour. but i did see a sign in there reminding everyone to make sure the broker was credited for any tours. so fucking stupid seems like it's almost impossible to rent without getting scammed in some way. personally i've decided it just isn't worth it anymore - even if you get the place, you are still being scammed with the rent price and the price of groceries right now. my next stop will not be in nyc. if you never saw the property, in person or virtually, with the broker then you aren’t their client and the leasing office will respect that. similar thing happened to my partner and i when we were apartment hunting. a broker offered to show us other apartments, asked us to meet him at an intersection, and then brought to several buildings that we discovered after were no fee.  fucking scumbag. brokers are such a scam - for the last 2 nyc apartments i lived in, i was just done w brokers and made it my life mission to never pay a broker’s fee ever again. instead, i just asked the supers of the buildings i was interested in to share the landlord’s contact info w me. note that i had already been living in nyc for a while and was already in the neighborhood, saw the supers frequently enough, and they passed along contact information. i also didn’t live in any luxury high rises. never ever pay or interact with a broker. their jobs are obsolete and can't disappear soon enough. i lived in stuytown for 3 years on van buren between lewis and stuyvesant. greatest hits of worst brooklyn apartment buildings. i would imagine the folks who are showing you around are affiliated with the same group.  the sketchball that brokered us ended stealing like 10k in fees and disappearing. he never fucked with me too much to be fair i was an adult, also a landlord, and wouldn't do anything without it being in writing in front of me, witness and all bases covered. they will try pull some absurd shit.  these ""brokers"" are thugs for the hacidic landlords in brooklyn heights. we had an understanding because i paid for services rendered and they tried to get me to manage the building then we found out they bribed the inspector and it was deemed ""uninhabitable"" by the ha but really it was mostly cosmetic, so i after my lease was up i stuck around for a year for free. was between city and the landlords. sure they send thugs around and the other residents would start crying when they received civil court summons that were cleary photocopies and so backdated that they would arrive 2 days after the summons.  i know a lot of folks that moved there in 2015 from the midwest with a hope and a dream and their parents money and got fleeced out of thousands of dollars before discovering the apartment didn't exist.  my favorite scam at the time was the landlord that replies to you and says all good but i'm out of state for work so send me first and last plus brokers fee and a copy of your id and i'll mail you a 🔑.  idk how people fall for that but i learned at a very young age that once you enter the 5 boroughs basically you're in a third world country. what a mess.  god i fucking miss ny. why would you do that in the first place? wow that’s so messed up. question, isn’t peter cooper just across the street from stuytown. is the apartment similar or different. man! i wish i had read this last night. just fell for this exact scam. my friend (with whom i'm getting the place) signed this letter. is there anyway out of this?",132,29,negative,0.8913012146949768,161,i just fell for this exact scam. my friend (i'm getting the place) signed this letter. is there any way out of this? i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'm getting the place. i'
143,Ways to make extra money when you have your own apartment ,"do not pass up the nyc housing lottery. when i first moved into my own place a bit out of my price range it helped motivate me to get to the “next level”, and so on. you can do this. if you have to work two jobs just to afford living alone you can’t afford it. how much is the place? if you really want to live alone you find a way. live far away in bk/bx/queens. jersey. you can absolutely find something. bro please take it, i’ve been waiting 6 years for the lottery apartments. this is your time, and i’m sure whatever you decide-dog walking or something remote (typing subtitles, editing kids papers, etc) it’ll be worth it if you want to live in ny for a long time. when i was really poor, plasma donation was a good source of extra income that didn’t require much time or effort. take it!! once you’re in, you’ve got it. find a side hustle — dog walking or pet sitting is great. also there are often a lot of random freelancing opportunities around lately bc many nyc companies are in hiring freezes, but the temp roles for a few hours a week are nice to tack on! depending on your skills get your resume to recruiting and temp firms… good luck — it’s a dream to get a spot for that amount… as a 30-something also in nyc, i am rooting for you!!! you could also babysit, i did it all through grad school and made great money. often the kids were asleep the majority of the time and i didn't care if parents stayed out later cause i made more money and just had to take an elevator to my place. we had an online message board where i could post and i probably ended up with 10 different families at one point. dog sitting? $1400 is a damn steal, if u dont get off ur ass n go figure it out. chile, as expensive as these damn apartments r at full price, and its 14k luxury!?!? .. smfh you don’t have to take it. being house poor for a place you don’t even own is insane. if you choose to ignore us and do it anyway you’ll have to pick up a second job: bartending, tutoring, part time retail  maybe teach esl online in a diff timezone so you can do it overnight  get a higher posting job so you don’t have to work multiple  overemployment (2 salaried jobs at the same time) if 1400 is massively expensive for you and you live in nyc you might be living in the wrong city. if $1400/month is ""massively expensive"", i think maybe you - don't belong in ny? i make 55k a year and pay $1500/mo for a rent-stabilized apartment in harlem, and it's really not that hard to manage financially - i even travel a few times a year. do you take ubers everywhere? do you not cook? do you have a big student loan you're paying off? you may just need better budgeting skills, not ""extra income"". if your building allows pets you can board cats/dogs! i see people looking for pet sitters and saying $40 a night is “cheap” for them because overnight boarding at daycares are a lot more. it’s good extra income and you get to hang out with cute pets dog walking in les, uws, ues, williamsburg and the sorts focus groups. google nyc based focus groups or research study opportunities and serve as a candidate. easy money usually in the form of prepaid visa gift cards. use that for groceries/transport/personal expenses and save paychecks to put towards rent. sorry, but you’re 30 and you think $1400 is expensive?? and in nyc??? there’s no excuse here. use google. find each and every way possible to get money. set goals for yourself. you can make $150 a day with all the freelancing opinions out there like door dash, task rabbit, etc. $150 for 5 days, $750. that’s $3000 a month. taxes would get you down to about $2200. so, can you go on extravagant trips and expensive dinners? probably not. but no way can you say that’s massively expensive. it’s a goal you can reach. you got this. bartend or serve a couple nights a week run an underground poker game, but it's illegal... caveat emptor! how long did it take you to win the lottery? do catering or something similar in hospitality   you can make $1200 or more a month just by working 2 days a week. dog sitting and walking! in my (huge)building there are a couple of sitters/walkers everyone goes to because they post their services on the internal forum. only fans on your day off from work or delivering food if you love animals, then try rover. you need to be comfortable with pets, and to screen them carefully, but boarding one small dog at a time in your place might be a good way to make money. speaking from experience, take the apt. i won a housing lottery multiple times in nyc and finally accepted a studio a few years ago. it was the best decision i made. it made my nyc experience just that much better due to its prime location and quality of nyc neighbors/network. rent will only get more expensive. lottery apts are typically rent stabilized for 30 years at max increase of 4% per year. take the apartmet - walk the dogs  but create a business out of it just a small business to get you by and some spare profits to keep you more stable.   charge $50 for an hour walk.   10 pack for $450   20 pack for $800  unlimited walks a month for $600 (expires every month)  set 2-4 times that works with your schedule everyday.  let’s say that you can do 2 times only morning and evening.   make a group of 4 dogs make it your goal.  when you manage to fill the 4 slots and the 2 times 5 days a week.  you’ll be making about $7200 a month.   if you only have 1 dog 2x a day for a min of 20 days a month = $1800  offer extra services like overnight watch for $100 per night.   create a personal brand in your ig.  offer a lot of value and show that you care for the dogs ask questions and give more and in no time you’ll filled the 4 slots 2x a day min of 5x a week.   after a year you can learn how to groom and start offering more care services for the dogs.   you got it. do you have appealing furniture? you could rent the space occasionally for small photoshoots or podcast recordings.  outside of the apartment, pick up a catering job that lets you accept or deny the shifts as they come, that way it's some extra income and not a set schedule. you could look into donating your eggs/sperm dogwalking, reselling, babysitting, something remote. even better if you can do both jobs during the same timeframe. you could rent out out your internet connections to your neighbors for monthly fee sell your poop. tantra massages onlyfans. joking, but also, from the sound of what people make, not?",132,112,positive,0.516240656375885,244,?s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. it’s not. but it’s not insane. take it. get it.

145,What’s the next LIC?,"mott haven in the bronx. the amount of luxury condos and restaurants opening up in the south of bronx is unreal!  that or central/east harlem up by 125th st. they are investing $2bil in real estate in that area with a lot of big stores on the verge of opening. the area on northern blvd extending away from queensboro plaza is a logical extension. lots of big box stores, car dealerships, etc… within a few blocks of the subway. you could replace them with high rises without displacing residents like most other areas in the city. if you're talking about the vibes of lic with waterfront apartments, parks and tall buildings, the only thing i can think of is the new greenpoint waterfront. they aren't much cheaper, unfortunately. everywhere else is mainly focused on smaller boutique apartment buildings due to legal restrictions (thanks, albany).   the next focus of nyc's real estate market, however is still bushwick, ridgewood and the south bronx right across from the river. south bronx will resemble these waterfront areas eventually but its going to take a long time considering the area's seedy reputation. astoria, near the trains. the broadway/steinway st station area is great, used to live there you will see more dev in dutch kills and skillman ave area as soon as they run out of space for new dev in lic. south bronx here.  give it 20 years lol gowanus. in 5 years we won’t even recognize the neighborhood. jersey city ridgewood for sure astoria, right next door mott haven/ south bx honestly, at this point i just want everybody out 😩 or for someone like blackrock to release the damn apartments that they have please us poor unfortunate souls need hovels to live in this is the million dollar question isn't it? there are good neighborhoods to move to that resemble what lic used to be, and there are neighborhoods primed for development booms.. ridgewood/bushwick is a nice place to look at for sure but os my money it's not going to be the next lic. gowanus would be my bet for the next 5-10 years, greenpoint waterfront is going through it right now east new york i think woodside is pretty slept on. it's quicker to midtown compared to a lot of astoria and has a few good strips of bars/restaurants (less than astoria but so does lic).  this could also be me subconsciously not wanting rents to go up in astoria. but i also think astoria has been more desirable for much longer than lic has. lic is a construction war zone. i just moved here in november from forest hills. though i love the quick commute i hate the noise pollution. can’t win in nyc. if you’re not one of those residents who only plans to stay for a certain number of years before a scheduled move back to your home state, then i would encourage you to invest time in marathon walks around different areas. you can find your own “next lic.” the best thing i ever did was move out of lic and to sunnyside which is just slightly down the road. i called my move “moving to the burbs” because that’s literally how it felt. lic is more intense than manhattan for me. australia rego park or forest hills as far as looking to buy, my mind was blown away when i saw the price for a 1b-1br in bushwick for $1mill+ i moved to lic 6 years ago and the rent prices around here are insane now but thankfully my apartment is rent stabilized so i'm paying much less than what these new buildings are going for. woodside or forest hills south bronx (mott haven) the simple truth is that any neighborhood that provides what you are looking for, ie safety, grocery stores, train access within 15minutes of midtown will always quickly become overpriced due to the persistently high demand. if that sort of neighborhood is beyond your budget, you'll simply get displaced every few years, unfortunately that has been the reality for nyc over the past decades of gentrification (but truthfully for the past centuries as well).    now, barring any disastrous event that would cause demand to crater in the urban core akin to the white flight of the 50s and veer the city towards insolvency and a deteriorating qol, our only solution is to   a) have a massive construction boom in those areas that would bring densities to hk levels and fill up the demand. let's be honest, the hudson would sooner freeze over.  or b) have to decrease our expectations for a neighborhood that fits our budget. as you said, having a longer train commute is the first thing to adjust.  i would add another consideration, which is that if you don't mind a little bit more risk, those ""ungentrifiable"" neighborhoods with a high concentration of nycha projects will take much much longer to have prices irrationally increase.   so east harlem (i was just on lex & 125th, my god i can't believe the juxtaposition of the new flashy buildings and the street life), or mott haven, or further inland.   hunts point has been historically the worst of the worst. but they have a new metro-north station coming. you might be able to snag a good value apartment that will stay affordable for a good 20 years until the area is finally cleaned up. and the new starlight park and the bronx river house with the kayaks is a true gem i discovered on a bike ride. i couldn't believe seeing a huge school of fish in the bronx river. south bronx definitely mott haven mothaven bronx washington heights/inwood mott haven mott haven in the bronx. it sprang up just as fast, if not faster, than lic. mott haven lic sill has a lot more room to expand, and the neighborhoods adjacent to it are seeing similar developments.  in terms of a brand new neighborhood, developers are trying to replicate the lic development pattern in the south bronx.  whether it will be successful is another story. honestly, valley stream and lynbrook in long island.  both have long island rail roads that will get you into midtown in about 35 minutes, new condo developments, stores and can be acquired at decent prices.  both are really close to queens as well, and really aren’t as suburban as i though long island would be weehawken, west new york, and north bergen. lic increased in value due to easy connectivity to hudson yards, where multiple corporations have long leases.   the places i mentioned are still in convenient proximity to the city, especially by ferry. moving forward, i predict that more people will be commuting by ferry. school districts in these neighborhoods will improve over time, as prices go up, further attracting young parents. new rochelle! great city and just a 25 mins train ride into grand central the south bronx, the south south bronx. college point. definitely mott haven, people are really nice and down to earth. lived in lic for a few years and hated it, people were way too rude. east harlem there's no other lic in nyc. waterfront. proximity to midtown. access to the best queens food. access to laguardia. access to williamsburg, too? direct highway to the hamptons? some might say mott haven in the bx, but the bronx does not have the range of cuisine that queens and brooklyn have. west new york? cmon, now. that's the jerse. lic really is something out of this world. i wouldn't call it the new lic, but consider harlem. specifically the area around fredrick douglas (8th ave) and 116th. great value and a better location than lic. it’s gowanus rego park ? can also walk to costco from certain areas i'm😦 what about flushing or willet points area.  they are planning waterfront communities there some say philadelphia. inwood is jackson heights next on the list - not familiar - but i feel it ticks the boxes from what i know? i feel like it depends on zoning law so knowing where will be upzoned next is probably helpful. i would say it's too late now but greenpoint rockaway beach. no it’s not washington heights up around 175 th street n up , a train n nice area sunset park? industry city is nice, and there’s some nice parks by the water. there’s shops, grocery stores, and such. great trains situation. gentrification seems to be coming. red hook the new unspoiled,  hip neighborhood is cairo ny, about halfway to albany. every neighborhood in nyc has been gentrified since the 80's.  there is no inexpensive place left here. gowanus! sunnyside? rego park you couldn't pay me to live in south bronx. the bronx is a long commute. it’s more than an extra 10 minutes. south bronx. jersey city lic as good as secaucus. move to manhattan brooklyn south bronx the south bronx, particularly mott haven. this is 100% the answer. it

If it is, what's the scam?","well you tour it in person first and meet them.  if they are in the house then it’s not a scam. most things that sound too good usually are.  if they are so high profile whey do they need to rent out a floor? ask to see proof of ownership. i had a friend who toured a place, gave a deposit, was given keys, all normal. she moved in and a day later someone knocked on the door asking wtf she was doing there. turns out someone had stolen and copied the keys and posed as the owner. real owner had no idea. she had to move out same day. my alarm bells are ringing too, but for pure curiosity, you should meet them and check out the space. at best, they’re eccentric and everything they’ve said is legitimate. at worst, you get trapped in a basement for a few months. either way, you can pitch the story lol. where did you find it? i mean if it was cl .... eh i lean towards scam. a lot of those townhouses are rented by nyu staff i thought. please update what happens. i’m so curious. and maybe take someone with you when you go to wait for you in the park while you check it out. can you take the room and then report back what the scam is?  because i’m leaning towards weird, at least, if not scam overthinking it. accept da bless. usually the scam is them asking for some amount of money prior to you seeing the place. if they let you see the place without paying and it seems legit, congrats. if they ask for money first, run. ![gif](giphy|id19muwzkmd6dyp079)  :stares in especially heinous: you should agree to check it out. no harm in that. if before you see it they’re asking for money as a guarantee or so you’ll be discreet or whatever then yeah scam. but stuff like this does happen. it’s just usually amongst your extended network. update us. i know and have worked with high net worth and very well known people. usually they don't rent their space out even if they need $, being concerned about privacy or not. they're old school it seems which is cool.. this may indeed be legit and they just a quiet tenant who'll pay off books cash income..   i'm usually circumspect about things but like handshake deals with good people i can trust. in this case you don't know them, can't trust them and need to verify who they are. it's a living situation and if payment is off books and there's no legit contract you'll likely have no rights.   they may be who they say they are, or there's a catch and you don't want to find out once it's too late. if in doubt get some sort of legal agreement/contract written up for basic rules- that you'll pay such and such rent monthly on time (and maybe a small penalty if late by 5 days), they can't enter your space without advance notice or a legit reason, you'll get any deposit $ back when you vacate and leave a clean apt, they can't evict you for a lousy reason if they're feeling fussy, you need to give ample time for notice if you want to leave, etc.   i can look up their names or their antique biz and check for any obvious red flags if you want. follow me temporarily and dm me. i'm so intrigued by this. what family with 3 kids would want to bring in a stranger to rent out an entire floor of their townhouse? with free access to the rest of their home? where ostensibly their children live? in one of the poshest neighborhoods of all nyc? and you found it on cl? and they're semi well known? and they have no issue with you bringing people over?   maybe if it were just one of these things situations, i can sort of see how it makes sense, but considering the entire scenario, i say it's a scam.   op: i'm rooting for you and hope for your safety it's not anything weird or scammy. is this satire i would take it at face value until they prove otherwise. it sounds like they want a house sitter that pays them, and i imagine you will end up doing little favors if they’re gone a lot.  try to get a sense of what their expectations are.  i can’t imagine it being a weird sex thing. how are they going to get rid of you afterwards?  maybe it has an ample trash chute, lol. no one who owns a $10mm+ townhouse is in need of $1600 a month, especially to give up 1/4 of the floors in their home. and they aren’t listing/selling things on craigslist either. the market value of having a whole floor in a greenwich townhouse is easily $10k/mo, if not considerably more.   you need to take someone with you to this appointment for your own safety. 0% chance this is real, 70% chance it will be a good story. how did you find this place? that would say a lot about whether it's on the up and up. if it was a craigslist ad, i'd run. if it was word of mouth through friends who know this couple, i'd think it was legit. i live in greenwich village and it’s impossible to live here for less than… a lot. please share your location with a few friends and meet them somewhere in public first! [deleted] **indicates real offer**: they are in the house, they behave 'normally', they do not pressure you, they are very clear with expectations of you living there  **indicates scam**: they never bring up/mention a lease, they don't easily show you that they own the house, they give off vibes of having unreal expectations (like you babysitting 3x a week) leaning towards scam. everything sounds so contradictory, they want to rent a floor of their townhouse to a stranger and are also very private and high profile? do they need the money? if they do, it goes against the idea that they’re rich enough to afford a townhouse or are private people. if a high profile couple had to rent their space to someone wouldn’t they just give it to a friend or someone who they know directly or through their circle instead of putting it on cl? ime housing stuff in nyc that sounds too good to be true usually is.  looks like you’re meeting them in public which is good! if the vibes are fine and you do end up checking out the place and deciding to live there, please make sure you have a lease dictating what you want. make sure to specify that they cannot be in your space is my first thought (landlords cannot but this whole deal is so vague so probably would be best to be clear about it). my husband and i are pretty well off and i could see us doing something like this when our kids are grown. we have let a couple of family members rent out our finished basement in a really nice area (not nyc) for very cheap in the past just to help them out.   that said, letting a stranger rent out the top third of our house while our kids are young and living at home? that's the piece that really makes me skeptical. i agree with others to definitely proceed with caution. will you be signing a lease? can't you google their names if you spoke to them? is there a lease included? if not, i’d be worried about tenant rights and getting kicked out without notice. they may be “high profile” but sounds like they need money (no one would open their home with young children to strangers unless money was tight). treat it the same way as you would any apartment, do your due diligence. questions:   1) are you a female and/or in your 20s? 2) is this a legal apartment, or just a room/bathroom? two of my best and fav apartments in nyc have been found on cl, posted by the owner. one had no pics! that one i was met by a friend who managed the property and i paid him cash on the spot for a deposit.   this was all over 8/9 years ago though. looking back i would never advise any of this anyone! you should definitely see everything in person. treat this as a business transaction/agreement no matter how friendly mom and pop they want to present themselves. people are strange, so who knows- this is definitely an odd one…. i am very curious!  i’d say go meet them and evaluate? if you get a weird feeling when you walk in, then you can always leave right away. maybe bring a friend / have someone wait there in case? google them a bunch, see if their photos match up what you find… if not they could be squatter to subletters themselves? as a parent of young children, i would absolutely never let a stranger live in my home, having free reign/access to the same areas as my children are living. so the fact these people say they have children makes it unbelievable to me. i mean this so kindly haha as a native ny'er and mom, if you want to/feel comfortable pm'ing me, i can run a background check on these people if you'd like. whatever happens, this is great material for your writing lol whatever happens let us know! maybe bring a friend with you? just be like ""we had plans to hang out today"" and get their read on it, reasonable people wouldn't be weirded out by bringing a friend along, unreasonable people are who you're trying to avoid.   if anything about what they've shared with you so far doesn't match what you see, it's a scam mr and mrs alec baldwin.?? what piece of information  do you have ? names - did you google? address?? anything? so you did a call or a zoom ? did they ask you to fill out an application? unfortunately every time i have come across an opportunity that sounds this good, it’s been a scam. in particular that they are not showing you the house when you meet. that said, i am hopeful for you! following cause now i wanna kno what happens i live a block from wash sq park, and this kind of defies belief. a family with children taking a random person to live in their house for an unbelievably small amount of money per month? if they desperately need the money, why rent it for a pittance? if they don’t desperately need the money, why give space in their house to a stranger? dm me if you want me to walk by and take pics or scope anything out! but i’m asking you out of an only murders in the building curiosity, not because i think you should take this. :-) this sounds very suspicious. they say that they own an artwork and antiques company? do you know the name? look up business records of it. is it in nyc? walk in. go in on a day when they're in the shop and say you want to buy something for a house warming gift when you do move in.  but honestly, sounds very suspicious. let me explain this to you . it’s a scam , you will lose money ! don’t be naive and stupid ! in this city no art dealer  is renting this place so cheap . stop the  dreams about cheap rent in nyc when reading craigslist: any legitimate place is through friends or a realtor. just give it up. you’re too scared to go there and check it out even with a friend and you’re acting like people on bloody reddit can tell from your post if it’s legit. just go see it or shut up about it. this def sounds too good to be true i’d ask to meet them at the apartment and i’d ask all of the questions possible bc def sounds fishy and if anything a throuple vibe for sure. hmmm i’m so curious to find out more. when do you meet w them?! it could just be that the wife knows what it was like to be broke and starting out and just wants to help someone. i don’t think it’s a sex thing. worst case scenario they take your background check money ($40) and ghost. ask for a 3 month trial before signing a year? it's a scam i know it’s a scam, but why hasn’t op admitted they never saw the place in person yet? it’s not legal to rent an apartment without a kitchen. they are supposedly wealthy business people who have three young children and used cl to invite a stranger to full access to their home.   now, does this make sense?    i wouldn’t have let a stranger stand in my doorway during a thunderstorm when my child was little.  people use bonded and throughly vetted cleaning staff to enter their homes when no one is present, and you just move in?  please do not meet them unless you take someone with you, or better yet, save yourself or your credit history and stay away. as someone posted.  do a search on the individuals. see who actually owns the place. you can look up last sale and who lives there.  do not give out any personal info such as ss# or bank info. if they say they need to do a credit check.  do not give them a deposit and by all means you should require a lease and have someone review it with you before you sign.   make sure it’s not listed on air b and b or elsewhere. i’ve seen a place advertised for rent way below market and the photos posted were not real and clipped from elsewhere.  grab the image and do an image search. if they show up on other sights, i would be suspicious . plz bring a friend when you go to meet them. just for safety. ok …. clearly i don’t have enough going on today bc i must know, what’s happening w this? did you meet the dad? is it a scam? what was he like? what did you ask? what did he ask/say?! did you get an address of where this home is? spill the 🫖 you need to keep us updated i'm sorry, this makes no sense. there's too much liability for them and virtually no upside. i'd be very, very skeptical. p give me the address and i’ll look up the owners for u what a whirlwind! keeping my fingers crossed that it all works out for you either way do you really want to live with a family and their 3 children? no thank you. look up ownership info on acris (nyc real estate db). ask to see identification. look at name on mailbox. make sure everything matches up. make sure you see the kids. if they're renting ask to see the lease. contact the landlord. at the slightest indication that things are adding up, run! this sounds too good to be true. probably want a third in their relationship is one of them nathan fielder? he uses cl a lot. some families travel a lot and having you be a live-in house sitter could be a win-win. most situations i’ve heard of like this are through friends (kids of friends being the lucky recipients). please keep us posted on how the meeting goes! they could be offering that price to draw in a tom of choices and then be really picky about who moves in that’s what i’d do i did know a family that did this in a west village town house so i wouldn’t say wealthy people don’t do this. wealthy people are some of cheapest people.   if they were looking to take advantage of someone i think they would be looking for someone desperate—not someone smart enough to work at the new york times. let us know how it goes! i used to rent out one of my bedrooms for a much below the market price. i didn’t need the money but the extra rent would help w some living expenses. i interviewed the person and wanted to make sure she was reliable and a clean person overall. she later told me that she thought my listing was a scam lol. so you would be sharing a kitchen with them and they have three kids? it’s probably that the kids make a lot of noise - they get up super early etc - living in a spot with kids is tough [deleted] i say go for it. you sound like you are cautious enough to spot any issues when you meet them and it’s not like you are signing over your firstborn to them. years ago i found an ad for an apt for sale that seemed too good to be true … and it was totally legit. one of the best decisions i ever made was buying it. when i first moved to brooklyn i wound up in a huge, gorgeous room in a family home in clinton hill. 800$ a month, full access to all common areas, could smoke inside, it was just ideal. didn’t quite know why it happened, but months later the owner told me i was polite on the phone, i showed up on time, i was dressed kinda nice, i asked pertinent questions, and i agreed to take it on the spot. she’d been fielding potential tenants for weeks and she simply got a good vibe from me. it was as simple as that.  don’t overthink it. take the plunge. hopefully i think it's probably fine. nice people being nice to other people 'just because' is actually a thing. people choosing someone they like and giving them the deal of a lifetime is also a thing.      don't forget your instincts, keep your guard up, but even though you assume the worst, the result isn't  always the worst. 'if it looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true', is true 99% of the time.  or another way: 'miracles do happen'.      and, if they want to keep a low profile, a post like this one probably wouldn't make them too happy.     finally- be sure to update us!  assuming you survive... muwahahaaa",125,282,neutral,0.5011615753173828,407,? i mean're a house sitter. i would assume they are a family with kids. i would assume they are a family that wants to rent out their entire townhouse.. i would assume they want to hire someone. are. i would assume they want to rent it out. i'm not sure. i'm not sure. but i think it's a scam..
148,what do you hate most about apartment hunting in nyc?,"shitty brokers 100% how little time you have to make a decision broker’s fees. i’m not aware of another major us city where the tenant pays the fee... for what is sometimes 5 minutes of work, no less! there have been efforts recently to address this, but in the unlikely chance something changes, landlords will just bake the fee into the rent instead. that i am freelance, have bad credit, and no guarantor. knowing the landlord can bend me over once my lease is up with an insane increase the amount of personal data you have to give to a total stranger. not to mention operated by a small company that you’ve never heard of.   what feels like every important/ financial detail of my adult life just handed over to someone for scrutiny, then sent to a third party.  i understand the need for this, i just wish there was more of a secure way of doing this, that _every_ leasing agency was required to use. how expensive everything is the dishonesty in almost every step of the process. it’s like you go into it with a sense of dread knowing that you’re either going to get screwed or that the potential is there because of the lecherous brokers, owners, agents, landlords or websites and everything is already expensive. all the requirements. i know damn well everybody dont have an 800 credit score, 80x the rent, and giving their first born children to move into places. i rly wnna kno how ppl are moving into their own apartments without having roommates. like normal everyday ppl. cus im 2 secs away from presenting a job offer letter as income like everyone on tiktok is saying to do when i was searching, i hated seeing photos that looked nothing like the apartment. now that i'm an agent i know how to spot the bad apartments right off the bat from the photos. coming across many apartments recently that require a guarantor no matter your income. absolutely insane everything how tiring it is to search and travel for it and how quick you have to be to get an apartment if you like it (and accept that fact that you might not get that apartment) how quickly you have to move and how that makes things like fomo worse. [removed] all of it.  realtors not even talking to you unless you make 40x, trying to get a tour, having 50 other people waiting in line to view as well , not being able to pay a year in advance anymore… all of it is shit.  every apartment i’ve lived in for the last 10 years took nothing to get into.  this time around i ended up putting my shit into storage and couch surfing.  it fucking blows fake pictures. i have literally gone to apartments where the views outside the windows are different than shown online, so clearly pictures of another apartment were used. just such a waste of my time. don’t work with shiek. he lists on craigslist, very attractive low priced apts but he uses bait and switch tactics and has a ton of yelp reviews on how he scammed people out of their money. i’ve also seen posts on reddit about him as well. this man shouldn’t even be licensed but his broker’s firm is first executive realty.   looking for apts sucks here and broker’s fees are an absolute fucking racket. when i lived in florida the broker service was free to people looking for apts and the complexes paid to be featured by the broker. way less hassle for people moving/looking for a place to live because you know moving is already stressful enough. good luck to you why do brokers charge the tenant the fee when they’re the ones working for the landlord 99% of the time? everything about it is absolutely terrible and continues to worsen our quality of life. it’s time for massive reform. here’s my thing, at what point does it slow down? because there will come a day that a 400 square foot studio costs $7-8k a month. then what? everything, what kind of stupid ass question is this haha. every aspect of it is absolutely terrible unless you sweat $100 bills. the price doesnt justify the apartment size. i didnt realize having a washer/dryer in the unit is a luxury - prices can go up + $1000.  plus the broker fee. goodness. it’s crazy... all of the above and the stress of having to make a decision so quick before someone else grabs something. broker fees. 100% broker fee. good luck getting anything with a cityfheps voucher. for me, the worst part is when listings look great online but turn out to be misleading in person. it's really disheartening to visit a place that doesn’t match the photos or description. you can set an alert for new listings on street easy. what i hated most where the prices. i was not willing to pay most rents because it seemed outrageous to me. i am not a native us citizen but moved here, but i don't understand why people would pay so much money just to live in a certain area my constant anxiety broker fee as an agent who’s quitting: everything having to literally keep tabs on a broker and hunt them down yet they want 15 fucking percent of the years rent as a fee. ridiculous sometimes i wonder if this madness is sustainable that you’re always competing with a couple who makes $800,000 per year how tiny everything is. i get that’s part of living here but as someone looking with roommates, it just feels so unfair to put someone in a tiny flex room. also the lack of windows in some places is so depressing   also, i have potential roommates but feel like im doing all the work. im the one viewing the places and searching for more roommates and all that and it stresses me out  might give up and stay in jersey tbh co-op boards. surprised they didn’t ask me to bend over. brokers fee everything bidding wars for apartments…drives me insane when brokers encourage that getting catfished nyc apartments suck expensive asf and small asl. my sister has a 4k, 1 bed, and it’s still so tiny.   you’re better off living in jersey. space is the most valuable thing in a home and you get none here",120,117,negative,0.8380120396614075,237,. fees are insane. i’m not aware of another major us city where the tenant pays the fee. fees are insane. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. everything fees are insane. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. everything. broker fees are insane. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. everything. broker fees are insane

150,15% Broker Fee?,"yep. the brokers [keep lobbying](https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/06/12/broker-fees-bill-council-hearing-rent/) against bills that would make landlords pay the broker if they choose to hire one. it’s super fucked and i really hope things change in the near future. [deleted] chi ossé has a bill in city council to make the landlord pay brokers fees, putting us in line with the rest of the country. may or may not get a vote this session, call your city council member and make sure they support it.   https://www.curbed.com/article/brokers-chi-osse-fees-rebny-rally-hearing.html there are plenty of units out there with a 1 month's rent fee. don't succumb to the insane 15% becoming more commonplace. i absolutely refuse to pay more than 1 month’s rent for brokers. these days they don’t even provide much help other than replying to emails. no response when you want details on certain things, no help coordinating the time to visit, but want 15%.  it’s absurd and they do it because some people become desperate. unless you actually need the place desperately, don’t succumb to the pressure. let the apartment be vacant for 2 weeks and they’ll come around. imagine going to the car dealership needing to lease a vehicle and when the deal closes the sales person asks you to pay him commission lol. i once had a good shared nyc apartment but was looking to live on my own. i could move out whenever i wanted so i had leisure to look at places without any urgency. i took the opportunity to let fly on inflated prices, on apartments in which the living room somehow became the ""second bedroom"" and the stretch of wall between a kitchenette and the front door was the ""living area"". i pointed out when buildings were in disrepair; i made complaints against everyone who asked me for 'key money', or when i found out the broker was also the owner. i reminded landlords that the price of an apartment should reflect a neighborhood and its transit options as they actually exist, not as they are anticipated to exist in five years. i nearly took legal action on a broker who had me meet him in park slope only to drive me three neighborhoods over to show me an apartment. i called out landlords who wanted me to ""fix the place up"" without even offering a long-term lease, and i pointed out when there were not enough power meters for the ll to be paying for the lighting in the hallways and on the front steps. in other words, i pushed back (and, after a year or two, found an awesome rent-stabilized place to live). i've long thought that nyc renters should crowdsource such pushback: after you find a place, go see five more, and call shenanigans and bs on shenanigans and bs in the nyc housing market. along the way, refuse the creep of broker's fees from 1 month's rent to 12% of lease to - egads - 15%, which is in fact 1.8 month's rent. and waste the time of anyone demanding that much. browse the apartment real slooooow before you laugh and walk away. city council is trying to make the landlord pay the broker fee like in every other city. the fare act  has strong support right now, let's hope it passes. yes! this whole system is totally fucked. what's worse is the brokers do not do anything for you and yet you're expected to hand them over thousands of dollars on the spot. check this out for more context and rage! i hear you op  [brokers protesting!!](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/06/broker-fee-ban-tenants-renters-real-estate-new-york-city-inflation-housing-apartments.html) when i got my nyc apt, i never met my broker, the apt tour was performed by the current tenants (im sure they weren’t compensated) and i found the apt by being directly referred by another tenant in the building. zero work by the broker was done and they still tried to charge a 15% brokerage fee, which we negotiated down to a 5% fee, but looking back the fact that it could be negotiated down that much meant that it was a nonsense charge to begin with. when i was looking in december, my corcoran broker, who wanted 12-15% (can’t remember which) would send me links from streeteasy…wtf?  really?  how is that even legal?  i generally saw the listing way before he even sent it! i have never paid 15% in 15 years of renting here.  its absolutely negotiable, and very very few brokers won't drop the fee if they really think you'll walk. [deleted] it sucks, but that's the rental market right now. when covid hit, all the brokers took a huge bath when everything became no-fee so its not like its a stable business yup, recently had to deal with this. i was able to negotiate a bit, but the rental market is so hot that if you are not willing to pay 15%, they can probably find someone else who is. 15% lol, in boston it’s 100% because people keep paying them - if the majority of the market collectively got together and refused to accept this as the norm, they’d be driven down.  i don’t understand why everyone is okay with it here - my experience with brokers has been horrible. in a slower season, they were largely unwilling to be flexible with viewing times, did little more than unlock the door, and sometimes would no show altogether. they provided near 0 value, majority had such sales scummy vibes as well. first time? i paid 15% b/c the unit was cheap, high quality, rent stabilized, and in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in nyc. brokers knew all this and like, yeah, tons of people would eat the broker fee for something like this.  i saved up, plain and simply, with savings i had built over the years while having roommates for even cheaper. with first, security, and 15%, i paid around $8k to move into my place lmao. price of admission i guess.   edit: more context the faster you leave nyc the better off you’ll be trust me….it isn’t worth the price of admission anymore you can search for no fee apartments on streeteasy they'll keep charging as long as someone will pay it.   this is one of the side effects of unbridled immigration. more people want to live in nyc than there are apartments. price is how society deals with shortages. it's supply and demand. nobody told you to live there!! if you can afford it, do it. it’s a one time cost, and yes, it sucks…but you don’t want to lose a great apartment over a broker fee. theyre just trying to get the poors out, which honestly at this point would improve nyc as messed up as it is.",116,99,negative,0.6607186198234558,215,"i never met my broker, the apt tour was performed by the current tenants, and i never got my apt through the broker. they wanted to charge me 15% for the broker, which i negotiated down to a 5% fee, which i paid. i'm not sure if i'm alone in feeling that the broker fees are ridiculous, but i'm sure they are. i've seen brokers charge 1.8"

152,Will NYC have a vacancy tax like SF?,"34 market is a great example of this tax being totally needed   also my building is half empty and units are infested with rats because no none lives in them   some have broken windows which makes the building colder   absolute joke i think our city government is too busy tripping over it's own two feet and being corrupt than trying to solve our biggest problems as long as we have eric adams the landlord loving extraordinaire — no no because any governor and mayor in ny has always been very much intertwined with the real estate board so that would get shot down instantly. warehousing - leaving unit empty until cancellation of rent-stabilized legislation - has been the trend these past few years. this is actually a great idea, given the trend of keeping units empty to inflate market prices via algorithmic pricing. not sure if this is an issue in ny, but absolutely is an issue in other markets that are dominated by 3 or 4 property management companies. it should. check out the latest horseshit the corporate landlord scum are peddling: https://youtu.be/xqpdu8k9yhk?si=c0nlap0alqlpoovc when in doubt, reddit will recommend a tax.  they love their taxes. what makes someone look at what’s going on in sf and thinks “hey! we should be more like them” new york's vacancy rate is alarmingly low, 3.1%, raising rents and making moving nearly impossible. what would a vacancy tax accomplish? getting rid of all available apartment inventory? there's absolutely zero evidence that these taxes actually help with either reducing vacancy rates or lowering rents. why would nyc want to copy a failed city like sf?

153,"Okay 20somethings, what’s the secret?","[deleted] i lived with roommates until i was 30. do you enter the housing lotteries? are you trying for manhattan? or does it matter where?  try a private landlord in a private house. lots of affordable places in astoria. i honestly couldn’t have survived here in my 20s without roommates and my now wife/girlfriend at the time. never paid more than $900 a month because rent was split three ways. i hope housing lottery works out for you, rents are out of control right now. there's always a guarantor service instead of family when i had a lower income (below 40x) a couple of years ago, what got me into my current apartment without a guarantor or roommate were my savings accounts. my landlord said that from looking at my bank statements he could see i had considerable savings put away and approved me from that. (i also had a guarantor ready just in case, but was told it wouldn't be necessary.) [removed] helpful to have a friend recommend you to their landlord, if there's an opening in their building. will still need to jump through some hoops but it's a great way to get a foot in the door - saves the landlord the advertising fees. so this isn't a perfect suggestion, but if you live in a neighborhood with a small, independent real estate office, go in and introduce yourself.  if there is someone with a few minutes, be pleasant and positive and talk about your situation. they might have connections to someone who might work for you, stay in touch, poke your head in every week or two and just develop a positive relationship. i think this is going to work better in say brooklyn or queens than manhattan. why would you think anyone, but *especially* someone in their 20s, is living alone in nyc in a legitimate apartment with poor credit? people sleep on craigslist a lot of old school landlords still use it. rental rules 20+ years ago were super loose. but nyc was a different kind of town back then.   2008 recession and eventually covid unleashed an army of renters unable or unwilling to pay rent. takes years to get rid of them. requirements to rent have become almost as intense as buying now.   landlords just want a tenant who pays rent. you are probably considered high risk compared to other applicants. nothing more to it.   you need to rent in a neighborhood that is considered undesirable. back in my youth that meant greenpoint. some parts of brooklyn and queens still qualify. and there is always bronx. i sort by the newest listings online, contact everybody by phone, and be ready to up and go for a showing. made sure all the requirements are prepared too to apply straight away because sometimes you are not approved just because someone else beat you to it. it helped that i had an extremely good guarantor also. i believe there's an online service that can be your guarantor for a fee. i found an apartment within half a month after moving to the city.  sorry if not helpful but good luck!! nyc real estate is definitely a beast daddy money is the secret for those 20 something we always had one roommate with very high income or a cosigner, then once you're in and have an established record of paying rent on time the landlords would let us add and remove people from the lease more or less at will. including if the high income or guarantor person left. this won't help you right now, but i think this accounts for at least some of the apartments full of people who probably shouldn't have made it through the gauntlet. honestly i suggest walking around a neighborhood like astoria or jackson heights or deeper in brooklyn and looking at the hyper local real estate companies or sometimes there is for rent signs on windows.  that’s how you find the gems.  if you’re familiar i’m with a neighborhood or want to move somewhere specifically just ask some of the business owners who have been there for decades, it’s really about getting the word out and connecting with people not searching on the internet.  a friend of mine talked to her local grocery market guy  who had been around for decades and got his $2000 2 bedroom in ridgewood this year i was feeling the same why when i was looking for appartements in may. took me 2.5 months to find something decent but also i live near the airport. obviously people just have lots of money, a really good credit score or wealthy family that can couch for them 🤷🏽‍♀️. not trying to be mean op, but based on your post history it sounds like you work at sephora... there's a ton of kids who are only able to live in nyc with parental support, but a lot of us came from nothing, grinded in high school/college, and got jobs in tech/finance/medicine/sales, etc.. in order to be able to live in one of the most desired/competitive cities on the planet. there's no get rich quick scheme or grand secret to how we do it... we have high paying jobs.     ""and my credit is like not great but it’s explainable."" credit scores don't require explanations lol, it's just the result of well known calculations. having a ""not great"" credit score likely means you've failed to pay obligations in the past, so a landlord has very good reason to not take the risk with you when it comes to your ability to pay rent. 20 year olds in manhattan have this awesome job called “child of rich parents” lihtc buildings. found mine and got super lucky. pay less than 1000 in rent basement apartments or places rented from grandmas outside manhattan and hip brooklyn. know folks who do both and paying 1k or less. it is true. if one’s credit isn’t straight and they don’t make enough or have a solid job history it is really tough to find an apartment and it is supposed to be. no one is going to risk this type of tenant. i’m not rich here. i found apartments living in brooklyn and queens. alone, two bedrooms, one bedrooms & studios. every time i qualified my job history was solid and my credit was clean. there is no secret to this really. finding a guarantor through a service the reality is you need a roommate plenty of 20 somethings working in finance or tech making well over 100k right out of school, easily enough to afford to live in a nice place with roommates or alone in a studio. i’m 30 making 150k a year and still choose to have 2 roommates. save too much money to give it up sublet listings on facebook marketplace/groups and craigslist fix that credit asap cuh- i use cred.ai it’s immaculate, but yeah trust funds? i’m surviving on ramen with 3 roommates 💀 they’re either making enough money to meet the requirements or they have a guarantor(s). guarantors or theguarantors 20x $2000 is 80k, most people i know are not making less. it's funny because i went to a r/nycmeetup thing and everyone made over 150k (based on public data) what 20 something year old in nyc *isn’t* making at least $80k in nyc? sorry for being nosy, but what do you do for a living? i’m an accountant and starting salaries are $82k for 23 year olds - and we get paid on the lower end of the professions. why would you want to live in an apartment that you objectively can’t afford? obviously, there may be situations with non-traditional income, but if it’s straight up that you make less than 40x the rent, i’ve always felt that the requirements protect tenants as much from making stupid financial decisions as they do landlords. the eternal question.  how in the actual fuck. minus the friends with wealthy parents, pretty much everyone i know in nyc had a roommate or two during their 20s. no secret - just pooling resources. i make six figures (200k+) and i still feel the pinch.  idk how most people are doing it either. a lot of people do have good credit, and that’s probably the answer trust fund [removed] i want to know too! i have a partner. that’s what does it for us. alone, i would have to have roommates but with my partner and i it’s manageable. not to be pessimistic or anything, but the harsh reality (at least in manhattan and much of brooklyn now) is that no one can afford an apartment by themselves unless they fall into one of three categories:   1. they are in a senior position in some fortune 500 company.  2. they are older and have been in their rent-regulated apartments for decades. 3. they have wealthy parents.   even with my partner and i making sufficient money, the landlord still required us to have a guarantor simply because our credit wasn’t perfect and we are younger. i’d also add that this is why some people pay so much money to rent a bedroom even if they could find a cheap apartment nearby (i know some people that pay $2400 a month for a bedroom in chelsea but could find a studio for only a hundred or two more in a nearby neighborhood, but simply couldn’t make it through the approval process). economic nepotism my roommate and i are 22 both making 6 figures and we barely got approved places. we end up picking between 2 and had a great broker. roommates. patience, and research got us through have you tried applying to mitchell lama apartments that have no waitlist? if you’re willing to live anywhere, there are some ml buildings in the bronx, queens, and brooklyn that seem to have no waitlist (or a very low one). i don’t have a ton of info about it, but might be something for you to look into. i think it's especially rough right now for new renters and younger people. the market has changed really rapidly (in favor of the landlords/brokers) in the last 2 years. i'm a native new yorker too so i get it, my first apt was $1500 around 7 years ago in a walk up in inwood. not sure how the prices are up there now but you do get reasonably large apartments for less money.  reality is you will need to show 40x the rent in some way for most landlords. i was making exactly 60k when i moved into my own place (obvi its even tougher now since rent is higher overall). i saw you mentioned freelance income - do you have tax returns from recent years or payment receipts that can prove how much you earned? bank statements showing deposits might help you make your case too.   best of luck! i'm always rooting a new yorker to stay in our hometown 💪 no roommates, not high credit, and not 40x rent - ultimately, imho, you have to remove one of these obstacles.   credit changes too slowly, so you either need to live far enough away from midtown/downtown manhattan that the rent is low enough or find roommates. deeper into queens (jackson heights or further), upper manhattan (harlem, washington heights), the bronx, or jersey city are probably the best bets for finding a place with a lower rent.  if being that far away is an issue (and it was to me at a stage in my life), roommates was the only available option. i had college buddies, so that was easy to solve, but there are a lot of roommate forums around with tons of listings. i would try to maybe take over someone’s lease. there are facebook groups where people look for someone to take over the lease entirely nyc housing connect or westchester county affordable rent (if you are okay living outside nyc) there are services that will provide you a guarantor for a fee usually worth at least a moths rent. if you know people in that situation then you should ask them! i don’t believe they are giving you the whole story!  i had a great job and my boyfriend worked too and we still needed a roommate and a guarantor (my dad). this was ten years ago. you can always try craigslist or friends of friends—as a roommate you may just rent a room from the leaseholder and pay them and they then pay the landlord…subleasing a room basically. if you’re initiating contact with the landlord rather than an existing lessee you’re probably going to need stays. use your soft skills to talk to everyone and i mean everyone. then insert casually that you’re looking for an apt. i found mine that way… also by walking around and calling the numbers on apartment buildings that are for rent but not being listed through a broker.. i’ll say that i and my other friend who’s literally a tennis instructor, we found our rooms/apartments in friends/friends of friends’ houses. if you have a multigenerational social network here, that helps. i will hopefully be moving in with grandparents and eventually succeeding their rent stabilized lease. look into this if you have elder relatives that need care anyway, if you have a relationship with them.   to live somewhere truly without roommates, you need some high- powered corporate job or internet or family money. but you can make the roommate situation more accommodating by rooming further out in the boroughs where you have more space.  and long term- housing lotteries and mitchell-lama waiting lists, depending on your income level. hope you have an easier time going forward! glad you’re not moving to florida hahaha! i’m in my 20s and did not meet the income requirement when applying for my one bedroom in astoria that’s $2k a month. it’s a gorgeous apartment in an older building with 700 sq ft, so even though i’m living above my means i think it’s worth it to budget some of my other expenses to make it work.   i got the apartment by being one of the first to apply and writing a cover letter explaining my financial background and how i am committed to affording the place. it’s a bit over the top, but i knew i had to do something to stand out haha. management was also pretty old schooled and was willing to work with me on adding some terms such as a higher deposit to make up for the income. the location definitely helps since astoria is still not as competitive yet with so many hidden gems and close to the city.   good luck to you! it’s hard out here enter housing lottery and wait, but then again if you’re a crackhead, dying or extremely old you will get one extremely fast. friends of friends, my current place for the last 10 years was through a friend, his boss is the landlord. i’m 27 year old woman and i live alone in nyc. i make about 55x my rent but it’s still a big chunk of my take home pay. i’m born and raised in nyc so i’d never live anywhere else but you do have to sacrifice. my advice would be to look for a not so great apartment in a nice area (not the other way around). also try to rent from friends of friends, friends of coworkers, etc so the requirements aren’t so strict. people tend to feel more comfortable/relaxed renting to someone who they have a mutual relationship with. ask around the secret is mommy and daddy i don’t think there is a secret   i’m 27, have been a software engineer for 4 years and make about 5k a paycheck after taxes   i didn’t have any issue finding a good apartment in my budget, and i would bet my many coworkers who make as much or more than me, who are also in their 20’s, have a similar experience.   i would never consider this a secret or that interesting tbh with you op [deleted] i found that i was able to meet the requirements after getting a job. maybe you should try it",111,158,neutral,0.5439633727073669,269,i was in my 20s and i was looking for a place to live. i was in my 20s and i was looking for a place to live. i was in my 20s and i was looking for a place to live. i was in my 20s and i was looking for a place to live. i was in my 20s and i was living in brooklyn. i was in

157,What’s the catch?,"doesn’t exist. if you don’t mind that, then you should def apply! if it's too good to be true then you better believe it. i’ve been looking for an apartment for awhile now. there’s been a huge surge in scams. especially compared to pre-covid. they seemed to have gotten by under the radar on facebook groups, instagram accounts etc for awhile but they’re getting bold and popping up on sites like streeteasy.  regulators need to crack down on this. it’s out of hand and getting worse they've been doing some stupid thing where they advertise the price of the first (half) month.  then double it for the real price on the lease for the next 11+ months. lol. thats fake. the catch is … that it looks like someone asked ai to create a new york city apartment listing lol i live around the block from here - no way it’s $1500. most likely error or just getting people into the door to look at units $1,498 is just the maintenance fee? this rendering looks faker than recent royal fam pics https://streeteasy.com/building/brooklyn-point/19c  this one? this sold for $1.2m with a $920 monthly maintenance fee.  if it’s not associated with the building, where are you seeing it? you have to do a blood sacrifice for it.  in all seriousness, if it looks sus, it is sus just put an area rug over the chalk outline in the living room. easy peasy. ask about a brokers fee. i’ve seen shit like this go for low but the broker fee was flat out $3200 it’s just bait to get you to call in, and that’s when they’ll tell you that one particular apartment has been rented already, but they have similar listings available. then they’ll throw in a couple of spells, and before you know it, you realize you just signed a lease for an apartment you don’t like, but you’re stuck with it. bro, charge your phone man! https://preview.redd.it/4431mmsab1oc1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=debca093aee24f30dce452434ace11bbb4cfdf90  this is the catch… what do they want?? i would call them and ask first. the photo has a silver tree which makes me think it’s ai bait and switch most likely i know some people at brooklyn real and i'd be really surprised if they were scamming. maybe they don't know their name is being used. i was a rental agent briefly in nyc. you’d be shocked how many advertised units don’t exist and are just bait to get you to see other apartments. i encountered one of these last month. it was a luxury studio apt for 1500, i’m like wow is this even true. anyways i applied, the guy called me and was asking me to sign something up and give a deposit of 1500. i’m like that’s all good but i would like to see the apt but he would keep talking around it. saying oh the apt is ready, dw about that the apt is yours, you just need to sign xyz documents and give me money. i kept asking that i would like to see the apt. all in all i was like okay i will let you know. but it clearly seemed like a scam! fake i don't see it on streeteasy probably misrepresenting a discount on first month’s rent as the standard rent. may be a scam, may also be an ad for their affordable housing listings willing to bet this was an accident 4198-4918 seems more likely it is an attempt to steal your personal information. they will ask you to do a credit check or to apply before showing you the apartment probably income restricted housing with maximum annual income of some where $4\~50,000 for single person. if not a scam, could be free rent and they average it down to that monthly amount but you have to pay the full amount to qualify for the free rent. confusing but it generates interest rabies and scabies looks like it was removed, but yes, obviously a scam phishing my friend is a real estate agent that do rental mostly. she told this is a kind of trick that some agents use to get potential new clients. it’s a real building/apartment. i’m guessing it’s a pricing error though. scam might be per night scam theres a lot on apartments dot com than se. they forgot about the other 3 digits...  https://preview.redd.it/uflfymv5tdoc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d6f111c41c37203e7a3a970caa9f4b3ac2a1e50 in new buildings like this the rent is $1,500 but the amenities such as the pool, roof deck, gym, common space, etc. is an additional mandatory fee. so yeah, that's a 3,800/mo studio.    or maybe it doesn't have a kitchen. slime drips from the ceiling from an unknown source i have 3 roommates on 142nd by riverside park, basically harlem. we each pay 1,200 a month it's a trappp report it never give money without first meeting the person and seeing the property. always always get receipt for deposit and if in doubt ask for the brokers license number. if dealing directly with owners then buyers beware. are you sure it’s not a photograph or super detailed drawing / painting?

158,Are StreetEasy listing prices artificially inflated? How much room for negotiation?,"yes, they don’t want to tip their hand. i’ve also run into brokers pulling pictures of listings after they’ve been rented there’s an app for landlord price fixing now, realpage. from what i heard it suggests what rent to set for a unit based on the rents the other landlords are gonna suggest. i doubt every landlord is on it, but there’s a chance it could be influencing seemingly random market movements. fyi its management companies not brokers that set the prices. my unit, and other in my buildings that i know, have all been listed as “rented” for a higher number on se after we signed a lease for a previously advertised number. usually results in rounding up to the nearest $500/$1000 there is a tiny subset of units that stay on the market for 90 days. that unit you posted probably has $3000 in fees to apply and move in, and some sort of max limit of how long they can rent    it’s not that surprising those get negotiated down. for a normal market priced unit in manhattan, unfortunately it’s not about negotiating but about being the first one to sign for the full price [deleted] i ran into so much trouble getting an apartment i could feel excited and comfortable with that i did not dare bother losing out by negotiating i'm an agent and i track interest and inquiries very closely. in general, this last year has been the slowest year (outside of covid) that i have seen in 12 years. i have had some units sitting on the market for 3-4 months with very little interest. however, in the last two weeks inquiries have skyrocketed. this is really out of the norm as feb is usually our slowest month. maybe owners are starting to adjust prices based on the increased inquiries. i just finished hunting for an apartment after about a month and here is everything i’ve gathered is happening from this experience:  1. when the price is low, they want as many people to show up as possible to create a frenzied bidding war, negotiating on offering more per month in rent as well as promising brokers a full 15% fee. the broker then pits bids (renters like us) against each other and lets management decide. 2. brokers 100% represent the landlord and despite any promise to advocate for you, they’ll ultimately turn their attention to the highest bidder 3. when they list the rental price high, landlords and brokers are trying to attract higher income folks to open houses and applications and avoid what they feel are less qualified/desirable applicants. 4. landlords aren’t the ones setting the prices — blame brokers. a broker whispers into a landlord’s ear and says, “3000 for this unit? you could easily get more. watch this,” and then the broker will start a bidding war. i viewed a one bedroom apartment priced at 3200/mo and it eventually got up to 3600. 5. rental price inflation is driven by desperation. not actual value.   the sad truth of it is that the rental market runs on “money talks” philosophy. not to mention you are also up against any prejudices brokers/landlords/management companies have against a particular renter that could get them thrown out as “unqualified.”  what really pissed me off about this process is that i pushed back on a broker who was trying to get me to increase my bid. i told him that comparable units in the area were waaaaaay cheaper and more spacious and his response was, “well it’s a free market rental so ultimately, if someone is willing to pay, that’s what the unit is worth.” i didn’t need a basic econ lesson to know that this was a bullshit excuse and i walked away from the process  the problem is that these brokers and landlords are using scarcity and our desperation as levers to pull. the prices we’re seeing are reflective of how desperate the previous tenant was to get their apartment search over with. and it’s all perfectly legal. on average not really. nyc has a construction problem. there simply isn't enough supply to keep on demand. this has been gone on for years.  sure there are brokers who try to play the market, but on average things are priced correctly.street easy also has a lot of metadata, if you play with their market data (you can pull things like median rent by neighorhood/bedroom) and get a good idea of the correct price is for the median apartment market (which in most neighborhoods is a non-luxury unit).  in general, i've had a lot of luck finding relatively good apartments for hte money and have helped friends do so. i am not talking about unicorn deals, but generally finding places that probably could charge 10 to 20 percent more and expect to rent the apartment. like my unit for example is a well maintained walkup with in unit laundry, dishwasher and ample kitchen space in prime les next to the subway. it costs 2700$ a month. without the in unit laundry it would still probably rent 2700$. its also not nice enough that it could rent for 3000$ in the winter market, because it is a small walk-up.similarly, i helped a friend find a large studio in ues in an elevator/laundry in building in prime ues (near both express subways in the liveliest area) for under 2500. this unit probably could have asked 2800$ and still expected to rent.  also your coming out of the winter market now, so you can expect prices to start going up. i've wasted far too much time looking at street easy and have to come to understand that if an apartment is sitting more than two weeks, its usually because something is wrong with it, the place isn't ready to rent yet, or the broker just forgot to take down the listing.  in the case of the unit your looking at, what explains the listing being up for so long.  1. its a co-op. the tenant would have to be approved by the board which takes a while. 2. it really seems over priced for what it is, especially in the october through january winter market. like at 4k, i would expect laundry in unit (in building at a minimum), a dish washer,   and possibly a door man.  likeli the management company and landlord new this, have just been prepared to let the apartment sit through the winter so they can rent it now, when prices are starting to go up. the past pics posted by compass are hilarious here:  [https://streeteasy.com/building/518-east-5-street-new\_york/5](https://streeteasy.com/building/518-east-5-street-new_york/5) they really aren't inflated. the housing market here just sucks. of course you can ask the broker to put in a lower offer, but units move so quickly it's pretty hard to do that. how did you negotiate rent? i didn’t know this exists. i always think brokers don’t care because they can easily find another renter. in my experience yes, when i rented my apartment it was for $2400 but it had been listed at $2700. not sure if it had been higher and they dropped it down or if it was an inflated listing value. the pictures were really bad so maybe no one wanted it at the higher amount as someone who’s high up for se/zillow (surprise zillow owns se), we fight this battle with management companies daily. they sign clear advertising terms of use that prohibit bait and switching, inaccurate prices, etc. the management companies are the ones here who need to be scolded. yea and you’re the fool",110,49,neutral,0.5006212592124939,159,on average things are priced correctly. there simply isn't enough supply to keep on demand. this has been going on for years. there simply isn't enough supply to keep on demand. on average not really. nyc has a construction problem. there simply isn't enough supply to keep on demand. i've seen this for years. i've seen it for years. i'm not sure if it's
159,"People living alone below 14th for <$3k, what's your situation?","not quite below 14th but i have a couple of friends who grew up in stuytown and have had rent controlled apts since turning 18 (about 25 -30 years ago)  they are both beautiful, large, 1 bdrm apts and neither of them pays over $2k.  i'm so jealous i have a gem of a 1 bedroom apartment that i pay 2,200/mo. second floor walk up no washer/dryer/dishwasher obvs but has a cute fireplace and kitchen bathroom separate it’s in east village you have to call the apt’s directly i avoided a broker fee and was such a game changer only way to do it. not rent stabilized just a rare find when i renewed price only went up $60 and allows pets! $2495, in the east village, really close to bowery/astor place.   5th floor walk up studio, 400sqft, tenement building, bad view, but really quiet.   no one on this sub or in my real life can determine if i have a good deal or not.   it’s a nice little apartment and having my own place for $2500 in an area that isn’t loud in a neighborhood that is know for being loud. i would not mind more sunlight tho.  i first signed just a few months ago. it’s rent stabilized too. i’ve got a little 2 bedroom apt in the east village for $2,500. i got a pandemic deal and they’ve only raised my rent $100 each year since. very lucky- i’m never letting it go i moved out a few months ago, but i was offered lease renewal for this year at $2,050 in les. i moved in during covid, and while i wasn’t rent-stabilized, the landlord didn’t raise the rent too much on me year over year. it was a third floor walkup, gut rehabbed around 2010 to get it de-rent stabilized. it was a 1br, but the bedroom was tiny, so it was more like the size of a studio. it had a decent view/light. there’s a $1500 one bedroom in the heart of chinatown that’s been passed around my friend group for about fifteen years now. you have to walk through a muddy courtyard and the lights in the stairwell (collapsing in on itself, natch) have never worked when i’ve been there.  the apartment itself is fine, if you’re okay with a living room/kitchen combo that is about the size of a king bed, a bedroom that is the size of a double bed with about five inches of clearance so you can crack the closet doors and reach in (why they haven’t removed the closet doors is beyond comprehension to me), and the bathroom is a room with a toilet, fairly generous clearance for knees, and the shower is the whole room. obviously there’s no dedicated bathroom sink and you use the kitchen one. it’s not that bad, it’s really only like 3ft away anyways.  on the other hand, an old family friend has a one bedroom in prime soho for $1500 (at least it was ten years ago) that is well kept and spacious. idk if that’s rent control or sweetheart family deal, everyone is cagey on the details. rent stabilized two bedroom in two bridges 1750 i took over a friend’s lease so it has been great. would love to give it to another friend after i move out. $2700 (was $2500 before increase) for a large studio, walk-in closet, and elevator/laundry. part luck part browse streeteasy for fun and when you notice a building with decently priced apartments, bookmark it. this is in the ev. two years ago i was living in a decently-sized, renovated studio in chinatown for $1.8k. the building was clean and well-maintained; i never came across any rodents or roaches during my year there. the catch was that it was a 7 floor walkup. would be dying anytime i had to do laundry or bring groceries up. i moved out of manhattan a while ago but i have a bunch of friends there who hit housing lotteries for rent stabilized apartments in some of the nicest buildings in all of nyc. even my grandma just hit a housing lotto at an awesome building on 6th st and 3rd ave that’s only for seniors. another one of my friends hit the housing lotto twice in different areas $2.5k junior 1 br in east village. 6th floor walk up but i have a washer/dryer in unit!!! stairs are not an issue as you get used to it. lived here 3 years and my rent has only increased $75. back when i lived in chinatown, manhattan - rent was $800 for a 2 bedroom. it was bumped to 1.2k after the pandemic.      big con is, the kitchen smells of dead roaches. my uncle refuses to clean up the smell, or it's impossible, because it's a 60+ year old grandfathered apartment. it will permanently damage the sinuses if one lived there for too long. i live in alphabet city right off st marks. i pay $1950 for a really decent studio. been here since 2021. 2800 for a studio in soho. decent size, elevator, laundry in building, good light, and extremely quiet. no dishwasher though.    just got lucky with timing because i happened to be in the area when it got listed and saw it right away before anyone else could beat me. true 1br in ev right across the street from stuytown. 4th floor walk up, pre-war, no washer/dryer, no dishwasher, tiny little ""kitchen"", but beautiful exposed brick walls and decent light since i'm so high up. got lucky during panini and signed for $2050, not rent stabilized but landlord is great and has only raised my rent $50/year in the past 3 years. i'm never leaving. moved to queens during the pandemic i lived on orchard street for 1900. didn’t stay because it was loud as fuck live in the ev in a 4th floor walk up that is a small 1 bedroom and small bathroom for 2700. i think the reason people probably wouldn’t love it zero amenities and the shower is a small cube. been here 4 years and rent started at 1850 during pandemic i had a rent stabilized covid deal.  not sure if you count this one, but i moved out of that apartment and live in a coop i bought and it’s still <3k (but the trade off was the $$$ to close) i had a 2 bedroom in gv during the pandemic that hit $3k on renewal, and when we vacated, it jumped to almost 5k. the bedrooms are very small, but had a decent living room. the dealbreaker wasn't obvious to me even though i saw it on a weekend night when it was still empty and it seemed fine: it's above a bar and it is very loud. you also hear all the insane people walking by. it got to me so i couldn't justify the $300 rent hike. this was a landlord that was decent and had decent prices until the post-pandemic hike hit. now a studio costs more than the 2 bedroom we had. it has a new tenant every year. no guesses why. alphabet city babyyy we have hella rent stabilized rent stabilized 400sq ft studio in the east village, close to astor place currently splitting $2150 with my girlfriend. on our third year here, originally signed for $2000, with 1.5 months free, $1750 net. no dishwasher or laundry in building, but we’ve got exposed brick!  we’re both making more money now, and mostly work remote so we’re moving at the end of our lease to find a 1 or 2 bed in brooklyn. our budget is gonna be $3k, and there are some pretty nice places out there in neighborhoods like crown heights, greenwood, even park slope. bushwick too, but we both kinda hate bushwick lol 3bd 1.5 ba 1200 sq ft apt in chinatown. i pay about $1500/month. elevator and door man. no in home washer dryer though. no other amenities i lived in a two bedroom with a balcony in les (it was on ave d) for 2k right after cobid i gave lease to friends and they recently upped rent to 2.4 it was nice the walls were super thing same w celing but beside that it was great! i pay $2500 for around 450sq ft studio (not technically a 1br but have french doors that close off my “bedroom” area) a few blocks north of 14th, east of usq. laundry/elevator building. got a rent stabilized deal during covid and entered at $2350. i always joke with my friends that i’ll die in this apt.. truly no reason to move as i would be sacrificing location and/or amenities to get close to this price for a studio and would be looking at $4k for a comparable 1br. rent stablized.. been there since 1997.. very small 2 bedrooms.. 450 sq ft but great light and location.and layout . we gut renovated new kitchen and all new floors..  . $1550     this is what these crap apts should cost!  anywhere else would be $800 -1000 yall pick the most expensive areas for the aesthetic like upper west side,soho, midtown etc. when you got to realize those place are no longer built for regular civilians like us it’s strictly for the rich and they only look for people with a 700 credit score and got to make 900x the rent and they know it’s impossible for single people yet alone low or middle class people and it’s sad for us right now but if you want to live alone in nyc you’re going to either have to live in places like upper manhattan, or astoria etc that is much cheaper , i seen places in upper manhattan and around washington heights,nice parts of harlem for 1400-1900$ a month 1-2 bedroom and bathroom, if anyone needs my help i’m not a broker but i help single young people like me struggling find a place for less than 3000 a month and safe areas too! dm me! those places charging over 2k-4k a month for a 1 bedroom is robbing you. $600 1br greenwich village 😉 there are a couple 19th century tenements under washington square park that you can get a for under $3k. best bang for buck to live downtown imo cause of the location and spaciousness (essentially a 2br) but they’ll be off true market in a hour. rent stabilized apartment a couple streets above 14 st (in chelsea). it’s a small studio (300-400 sqft?) it’s a great layout in my opinion we still have a decent sized couch that fits 3 people and a queen sized bed.  i’ve never measured. we pay $2001/month i’ve been here for about 3 years now. it’s an elevator building in an amazing street. no laundry in building which is a bummer but at least we have an elevator in a building where it’s not legally required. nothing fancy not even a dishwasher. however, my landlord let me renovate the unit. i put quartz counters in the kitchen and did a gut renovation in the bathroom. it was pretty cheap as my partner is handy. we bought a “second” home upstate and kept our apartment. hoping to one day be able to leave our apartment and buy something in the neighborhood! most likely about 5-7 years away from that goal as i want one bedroom if we are leaving the our cheap apartment. i have a 400 sqft studio on the second floor of an elevator building on 10th between university and broadway.   i also live in 1997. i have a two bedroom in manhattanville for $2317. it’s rent stabilized. never been happier. i live in a rent stabilized building in lic, 1bdrm/700 sq ft, got in at $1700. after three years it’s about $1850. the building has absolutely zero amenities but the deal is crazy and i never really have anything go wrong with the apt. i’m in soho, 3800, 1 bed with washer dryer in unit, all amenities from a gut rehab from 2019 when we moved in. it was reno after a fire! 3 tenants that lived through a half burnt building kept their rent controlled apartments so they’re paying 1k! we’re on “3rd” floor walk up. our lease renewal was march 2020 before the lockdown so we were paying 4k all of 2020. then in 2021 they dropped us to 3200. 2022 we payed 3400, 2023 we paid 3600. they’ve been increasing 200 a year. honestly we’re still below market. if you can get an apartment with veracity i highly recommend. they own about 8 buildings. they literally are on top of everything. one time my dryer belt broke and they replaced it within 24 hours. i thought it wwas going to take atleast 7-10 days to get a specialist lol.  no rodents\pests, safe and we have a dog too. we don’t pay extra for him. granted we’re about 375 sq ft. i just love hudson river and can’t imagine being being more than a 20 min walk from her lol stop gentrifying chinatown and the ev. get roommates, you can easily live in an apartment in lower manhattan with roommates for 3k. if you want to live alone, move to jersey and commute. or move to the uws or ues — then.the tourists won't drive you crazy. $2045 in canarsie. limited public transportation but ample amount of parking. mill basin, canarsie, and other parts of east brooklyn have decently priced apartments compared to west brooklyn. move the line north by 102 blocks and i can participate. oh wait i don’t live alone.",107,104,positive,0.6215466260910034,211,andrd avenue. she lives in a beautiful building on 14th st and has a great view. she lives in a beautiful building on 14th st and has a great view. i live in the east village and have a nice 1 bedroom that is rent stabilized. it's in the east village. i have a friend who lives in a nice building on 14th st and 3rd avenue

163,I built an interface to view all listings that match your search from all platforms (and to get alerted when new ones are posted),"i think it's a neat idea, though since it's a very new app i feel as though $25 per month for access when i don't even know if there will be any apartments which match my budget/neighborhood list is a lot to ask for. i think it would benefit from a free mode where people can browse but not contact people who listed their apartments, or at least a cheaper mode just for browsing (think $5/month). i think it's worth $25 to contact apartment listers but not to browse more context: this is a video recording of leaseswap nyc, an app i published (and posted on here about it) about a month ago. you can post the nyc apartment you’re moving out of and in exchange you get to see a list of soon-to-be-vacant apartments before they hit the market.   anyways, long story short people kept asking for access for people who don’t have an apartment to share and i needed to figure out a way for the app to pay for itself so about a week ago i added leaseswap premium which adds several features including instant access without having to share your apartment and access the alerts ui in the video where you can see all listings across the market that match your criteria and get alerts via push notifications when new one come up. this solves two problems i had:  1. i had to check out and setup alerts across so many different platforms every day 2. the push notifications on those platforms didn’t work very well and specifically for streeteasy i couldn’t figure out a way to consistently get notified about new listings.  premium costs $24.99/month or $79.99/year, which \_i think\_ it’s reasonable considering the amount of money and time it could potentially save you  would love any feedback: does it seem fair? not? is it a stupid idea? not needed? how can it be improved?  if you’re interested, you can download leaseswap here: [https://leaseswap.nyc/download](https://leaseswap.nyc/download) do tenants need their ll permission to advertise their apartment here?  what happens when someone wants to apply?  have you had any successful users of the app sign a lease directly with a ll? so needed omg downloading nice hi the ui looks amazing. feel free to reach out to me if you need any help with user validation testing or growth help! i am super interested and just subscribed. however, i have already encountered 2 bugs in the onboarding flow -- first with signing up, and then i kept clicking to unlock premium w/ a monthly subscription and it wouldnt go through, took like 5 tries lol you should let people know that it's $25 a month before they go through the signup process. now i'm stuck in a dead end. how do i delete my account? app is not available in my region, can you unlock to other countries. on the appstore it’s only available in the us, and i can’t change my appstore country because of subscriptions android?",107,23,positive,0.4480047821998596,130,i'm stuck in a dead end. is it available in other countries? or just in the us? or is it only available in the ? is it only available in the us? or is it only available in the us? or is it only available in the us? or is it only available in the us? or is it only available in the us? hi i love! i think a from $25

167,"$70k saved, salary 116k annually, is this enough to start condo shopping?","a one bedroom or what?  it really depends on the neighborhood/price but in general i would say “no.”  you need a down payment and you need to cover closing costs.  afterwards you’ll still need an emergency fund of savings. this leaves you with basically nothing, and even if you could theoretically put down very little (5% say) you’ll probably find the monthly payment to be too high. you can prob only afford a condo around 450k. go on zillow and see if there's anything you'd buy in that range.  use a mortgage calculator to find out what you're comfortable spending and what you can afford. it depends on the price of the condo, how much you want to put down, and what you want for a monthly payment.   note, 70k is 20% of $350k.  step one, you need to start looking at current housing prices. you need to determine what areas you are looking for a place at, how much the average housing cost is there.  step two, you need to start running the numbers. based on the location average, how much will you be paying monthly based on what you can put down. ask yourself if you can afford it (and not be house poor), and if not how much you need to put down so that you have a payment you can afford.  this isn’t a question people online can answer for you. you could afford certain coops with low down payment requirements, but there are very few condos you could afford. nj probably has more options. the issue is more just that there is a lack of older buildings that are condos vs coops, so with a condo, you’re paying more both because it’s a condo and because it’s a newer building. i considered this too. if you haven’t yet, you want to visit biggerpockets and a real estate subbreddit to get knowledge. $70k for a 3-10% down payment should get you some things; 20% not so much. whether they are good enough for you or not is open to interpretation. agent of almost 11 years here  you can come close to pulling it off, but i think you're just short in cash. i think you'd want to be spending somewhere between 450-500k to find something decent, which will require at least 10% down, and incur about 20k in closing costs.  can you borrow 20 or 30k for family? i think with around 100k, it's doable. it might need to be brooklyn or queens, but there are some 500k condos in nyc. almost all studios as an agent myself, i’d recommend having the pre approval first before shopping to see what you can afford which will help narrow the search and see what you feel comfortable. in addition to near term costs of down payment and various fees, most buildings want minimum two years of expenses in liquid assets. look at rebny requirements.  in nyc, there are not many condos and they are in higher price ranges. coops are much more affordable, which is obviously what you need to go for. you should be looking at hdfc co-ops. there’s definitely stuff you could afford. in fact, if you pm me, i know of a broker for a building in brooklyn that has availability and might be doable within your price range.   condo market is generally going to be out of reach for you with those financials. get a financial advisor that’s in nyc that can walk you through the puts and takes. nyc home buying is way more complex and has moving pieces across fees, hoa, mortgage (mega high rates atm) as well as tax savings. they can run a calculation for you that shows your tax savings and thus how much net you can save  it’s far more complex buying a condo in nyc vs your average town. shoot for $250k hi, you could do either, i slightly suggest agent because they may have more specialized suggestions of lenders that are good in the area you want to live in.   basic rule with condos if you get approved for the loan, the board will take you.   co-ops can have very different standards.   best of luck,   suzanne you’ll need about $100k (20% down payment) for a small studio condo. i’m talking murphy bed and mini fridge small. banks also look at your post-purchase financials, meaning you’ll still need to have a sizable amount of savings left or they won’t approve the mortgage. i’d say you’re 1/3rd of the way there with 70k saved up.  i get the appeal of condos, but they’re smaller and more expensive. when you eventually have more saved up, don’t be averse to looking at co-ops. your first step is to get pre-approved, then talk to a broker who will walk you through everything else. good luck! you should talk to a mortgage lender and get a pre-approval.  when you get it, ask them what the monthly payment would be for different loan amounts. with this, you can try to properly budget when seeing what maintenance/taxes are for apartments.   what areas and what size apartment were you hoping for? you also need to consider hoa fees which can often be a couple thousand a month, the fees can also increase at any time if they introduce an assessment on the building a couple of years ago a friend was selling, she had someone lined up who she was really happy about -- a retireee with a good pension, social security and savings from a house she sold in another state.  she had the mortgage.  somehow it didn't meet the coops board ""formula"" and my friend had to find another buyer.   so find out about the formulas used and how everything is calculated based on your income, savings, monthly payments etc. you might find a condo in queens for 450, but you cannot afford it. you will be house poor. i’ve searched, and make a little more than you, and the numbers don’t make sense. i settled for a coop for half the price, closer, and living very comfortably they say once you arrive at your first 100k it gets easier to get the 1 million. the first 100k is the most hardest… and you not that far away… what is your budget? you don’t have a lot of income nor do you have a lot of $ down. i would look into hdfc condos - you have a low enough salary that you could prob qualify for one of these places. agents might steer you away bc they take longer and more complicated to close but your competition is a lot lower. it is also harder to sell and rent so if your plan is to turn this into a rental, you may need to look elsewhere.   if you’re looking in the open condo market then i would say you need to increase your savings a bit more. not only do you need enough for the down payment, you need enough for closing costs and for reserves to pass both condo board approval and mortgage/financing approval.   recommend starting with both a good agent and looking for a mortgage broker who can help educate you on the different options available to you. objectively the answer is no—you should save more.  what if you lose your job or condo suddenly had an assessment or you need to fix something within the condo unit.  that 70k barely covers down payment and closing costs.  also unless you plan to stay in said condo for 5-7years it’s most likely not worth it unless you have excess money. move to philadelphia or something note that closing will cost around $25-35k that doesn’t go towards mortgage or anything other than just closing costs and you’ll need money for inspection (highly recommend you get it even if it looks good or is new) and moving. you can get a nice co-op in bay ridge with that. not sure if you like that. a coop sure . a condo ??? really gonna be tough you post this on circlejerks and inform your boss that you are too dumb to do a simple budget is it enough? probably since there are probably hdfc units you qualify for given your income level.  i probably wouldn't consider buying outside or that as buying in nyc is generally bad from an investment p.o.v relative to other types of investment.  property values are too high relative to renting. property values don't appreciate that fast here and can experience downturns or remain flat for decades.   also the interest rates are high and mortgage rates are highly likely to fall at least one to two  within a year or two.  you should consider that 70k has a future value of 1.2 million dollars if you left it sitting in a sp500etf and it grew at the average rate for 30 years. https://youtu.be/4bfhyvadjl4?si=qcwfjamif3tc-cdv go get the pre-approve letter from the bank then you will know what you can afford. you can probably qualify for a hfdc co-op that has income restrictions. these are a great value, though maybe not at the current interest rate, though generally do not appreciate much. check if you qualify for hdfc coops you can get 1 bed for 500k in east harlem or bronx. you could look at places about $300 or $350k in the bronx or outer queens, like rego park, kew gardens or further out. i'd say at least keep 10k saved, so look for something where you wouldn't put down more than 60k. mirroring what some folks have already said--be cautious when buying a condo. the fees can be high and unexpected, and you will have little choice but pay them, even if you disagree with them or dont want what they are being levied for. worse, the owners association can raise fees and thusly your monthly payments with little notice. with someone to co-sign… condos require min of 20% down and 6-12 months of living expenses in cash/securities after cash to close. just remember that. not enough to have 20% down, you need at least 30-35% just to put 20% down and meet the “post closing liquidity”. source: me. i bought a place and required a ton more money in manhattan, if you’re open to a coop- look at hdfcs. no. i have more saved than op and have a much higher combined income. co-ops are an easier way in but often come with $1200 a month fees. i keep having a hard time buying just to pay $1200 a month when rent is $2000  advice would be to keep saving and really only do this if you would want to stay for 10+ years to buy in manhattan banks typically not only require 20% down payment (minimum!) but you’ll also need enough left over in your bank account to cover 12 months of payments/hoa fees/taxes for a condo and 24 months for many coops. and don’t forget the impossibly high closing costs. the market is tough unfortunately due to all the cash buyers and insane taxes/mortgage recording fees, etc how are your current expenses so low? glad you're not wasting it on rent.  building equity is key.  especially in ny, the rental prices keep going up and who the hell wants to get stuck paying thousands per month to a landlord.  we've all been there where we had to pay rent at one point (or nearly all of us).  but the key is getting out and buying a property -- even if you start small.  even if its a small condo in an area you don't totally want to be in, you'll be happy to sell it 2x someday and grab a few hundred thousand that could be put into a house. sorry op you will most likely be buying a co-op. in my area of queens i can’t find a condo less than 650-700k lmaoo yes it's enough just make sure you clear up your credit a little bit because condo boards and co-op boards in new york city can be ruthless in digging in a person's background.   i managed to buy a condo recently in queens since i'm renting out my old house.  you still can find reasonably priced co-option condos you just have to get past the boards and the application process. i’m a re broker in nyc, and also licensed in nj (a nj native). get pre- approved first. you need to know how much you can afford. let me know if you need lender referrals. you can get a nice condo with a good firm payment down and spread payment condos have maintenance hoa fees don’t forget that too hey op, i’m very curious what your reason for wanting to buy is? what are the top reasons you’ve decided that this is what you want to do? thanks! make sure you consider hoa fees. a good rule of thumb is every $500 in monthly hoa fees corresponds to an extra $50,000 to the purchase price. for example if the condo unit is $400k with a $1000/month hoa fee you’ll need to be pre-approved for $500k. you should sign up for the affordable housing lottery (sales section) i’m an agent in manhattan and work the 5 boroughs. happy to help and at the very least point you in the right direction and go over your options. send me a message if interested i bought a co-op unit in queens for $175k making $70k on paper, no savings, 20% down. purchase was in 2018. i bought a co-op unit in queens for $175k making $70k on paper, no savings, 20% down. purchase was in 2018. i bought a co-op unit in queens for $175k making $70k on paper, no savings, 20% down. purchase was in 2018. for manhattan, it’s just not enough.  with a condo, you also have to worry about condo fees, which can be another 1-2k a month.  buy a house in the suburbs instead of you really want to buy now.  if you are intent on a condo, i would suggest keep saving and investing till your 70k becomes 500k.   a really nice manhattan condo will run you at least $1m+.  you can get studios for $600k, but they’re not worth it, imo. how do you make 116k annually if you earn 5-6k/month before expenses?   i don't see many people here talking about closing costs. your absolutely total max is probably around 300-325k which might get you a studio condo in south/east bk.   300k purchase price with 10% down  about 4% in closing costs  probably another 10k in lender fees/escrow  that's about 50k of your savings right there  there you have it i haven’t seen it mentioned in the quick scroll through but also think about closing costs.   theres a huge difference between coop and condo (coop being much cheaper). also new construction vs existing (if new, developer will require you to pay transfer tax). save one more year save one more year it would hurt my soul to hand over 70k to live in an apartment aka “a home”. that is so much financial security handed over in the blink of an eye. i would honestly sign up for housing lottery and hold on to your money. i have $350k saved and make $300k annually with no debt, and am also asking myself the same question. so probably not. sadly, no.   i applaud you for having saved so much. great job!  rule of thumb is to buy something 2.5 times your salary. that puts you at around $300,000 price. not much available for that price.   i  have a mortgage of 210k at 4.125 % that i pay around $1100 a month on.  figure at today’s rates a similar mortgage would busy me about $1800. you would need a bigger mortgage than $210, 000.  plus monthly fees. save some more. interest rates are too high. honestly just don't buy one in nyc . yes. ask tough questions. ask for the financials for the building. check the management company reputation, online. ask about active board. get your by laws from the county records dept. they will be original. ask how many of the owners live on site. versus renting out. house rules. fines. go for it. best wishes. that's enough.. upstate.. 😮 they want that to rent an apt for 3k buy in queens, look at jackson heights perhaps ideally you should have 2 years of cost (maintenance fees, emergency fund, etc) liquid after closing. you will also need 20% minimum to put down upfront. condo and co-op boards are no joke. sounds like you are still a year or 2 out. it doesn't hurt to get pre-approval to see where you stand but i'd give it a beat before actually looking at places. plus the market is really cold for sales. they will pick up after the election. your current options will be limited. just my personal opinion.",106,145,neutral,0.6410391330718994,251,for a one bedroom condo. you’ll need about $100k (20% down payment) for a small studio condo. you’ll still need an emergency fund of savings left or they won’t approve the mortgage. i’d say you’re short in cash. you can only afford a condo around 450k. go on zillow and see if there's anything you'd buy in that range. i think with around 100k
168,Is this rent stabilized railroad 3-bed apt for $3150 worth it?,"i honestly wouldn’t. you kind of buried the lede with the floor/roof issues….those are big, unfixable things.   if you two can afford $5k combined in rent, you can get something else. that apartment looks awful. with a budget of $4k, you and your boyfriend will be able to find a nicer 2 bedroom apartment in a more accessible area. i don't understand other people's comments - this just looks like a standard rs non-luxury pre-war apartment. seems like a lot of space, one corner window views, separate kitchen, that's a such a great price that there must more of a catch, and the broker fee seems oddly low for the rent so just make sure it's not a scam. what's the location and walk-up? this looks top floor is a 5-6 floor walkup? also if it's closer to port authority or somewhere weird than that would probably be a dealbreaker but maybe not depending where you're coming from.  edit: does seem like it’s pretty undesirable part of “hell’s kitchen” so wouldn’t rec but sounds like their current situation is worse. uhhhh……. yeah? it looks great.   have people in the comments never lived in nyc before?   that corner room looks huge with lots of light. the kitchen looks relatively updated (weird that it’s missing cabinets, but you could put your own stand-up wardrobe there for $150 - i did something similar). there are multiple rooms to have a nice home office and to sublet temporarily, like you said.   in terms of central air and laundry - adding those, as you know, would probably add $1500/mo. to this size apartment.  i think $3150 is a good deal. especially if it’s relatively close to the subway. would have to be more specific about the location. assuming the ceiling doesn’t actually cave in, it’s a really really really good deal. it’s huge. 1) the apartment seems fine. but exact location matters a lot in midtown to say “is it worth it”. for instance, not worth it if across the street from penn station   2) the people in the comments don’t seem like they live in nyc.   3) people don’t go online and write reviews of mgmt companies to let the world know how much they love them. people only complain. i lived in a bldg owned by one of the notoriously bad mgmt companies. super was very responsive and we never had any issues. they did require paper checks hand delivered to their office though which was annoying.   4) your bf’s apartment sounds like a fucking steal! if you don’t want to mess with owner to fix things, why not just hire a handyman to repair whatever is wrong? way cheaper than moving. you had me at $3150 3br in midtown. you would've had me at $3150 1br in midtown that isn't a total tire fire.  > mgmt co is also really big, meaning rent will likely increase by the max amount each year  it's rent stabilized so....  >floors in the kitchen seem like they're caving in, and the rooftop looks like it's about to collapse - no a/c and no laundry on site (these two aren't as big of a deal)  what do you mean ""seem"" and ""look"" like. those are two very specific looks and if you're considering this, i highly doubt that's actually the case that is an amazing price for the location and size, but the broker fee is crazy. effectively increases the rent to $3717/mo the roof might leak. no. they can’t increase “to the max each year” if it’s truly rent stabilized. i think apartment is pretty good considering the price. ac is usually never on site (in ny at least) fuck that broker fee. we just went to see an apt with a broker fee that was 12% (4100). nobody wanted it and the broker texted us over a week later offering it for $50 less.  also, property management companies i've now learned are full of people that are barely functioning adults and genuinely don't have any skills whatsoever. trust the reviews, they won't help you. i actively avoid them now if i can. could you guys come to an agreement with your bfs landlord to make repairs yourselves? based on the money you’re saving and that being the only real downside to his situation, i could see this as being an ‘everyone wins’? no that’s a great price for a 3-bed in manhattan (i’ve also been looking for 3 beds) but the broker’s fee is high. try to find an apartment with no fees if you can. i prefer small management, i’ve found them more attentive. the awful reviews would definitely deter me and i think sloppy renovations are telling in how management operates. you can get your own ac and washer, i’ve been looking into the black+decker small portable washer, washing machine for household use, portable washer but there’s also other options. good luck. 👍 no management company in nyc has good reviews. i tell people all the time not to base their decision off that because they'd never find a place, especially in the city where you have so many units under these large companies. nobody goes online to rave about their management company, only to complain you can take an m train from bedstuy to midtown in 35-40 mins. have you looked in bushwick? honestly i think your standards are too high. if you want to live in manhattan for that price point and have 2-3 bedrooms, that probably means a pre war building in a less desirable neighborhood or with a high walk up.   rent stabilization is great. i’m surprised you’re concerned about the “max increase” with that since moving to a non-stabilized place would mean risking much higher renewals.   i really doubt the floor has more than cosmetic issues. it’s hard to say how bad the ceiling is without seeing pics but if there’s no water damage i wouldn’t worry too much about that either. get renter’s insurance of course but otherwise it’s not a huge deal.   when we were looking last (wound up in a rs 3 bedroom in harlem for $2800) we decided anything more than 3 floors was a dealbreaker for us; we have a dog who needs to go out 4x a day lol. that being said we used to live in a 4th floor walkup with a dog and you get used to it fast.   the real killer here is that realtor fee. we paid a hefty one too but love the apartment (good sized kitchen 1!: living space, also has elevators, in building laundry, water/gas/electric included) and plan to stay for at least 5 years. since you don’t love the space anyway, you could try to haggle. a 5th floor walk up railroad is a tough sell for anyone who isn’t a young couple, so you may get lucky. use that money to fix up the bed stuy place rent stabalized? totally worth it if you're gonna be there for years and years.  3 bedroom close to $1000 per room per month is totally worth it. that’s objectively a good deal for a 3br in midtown manhattan. that’s a big no from me you can do better with that budget imo oh… def look for laundry on site. you will thank yourself. i don't think of railroads as 3 br.  i just think of them as 1br with 2 living rooms.   and for $3150 for a 1br 2lr, i think that's a steal for the area.    railroads can suck, but if you intend to live there for a while maybe you can add some temporary walls to unrailroad it and make small bedrooms? a true railroad flat means you one room goes into the other. with renovated rr except for the main room all are small because a hallway had to be formed out of the rooms. there's probably a long room at the end of hallway. can do better especially now that people start to move in spring and summer. think college kids moving on. at that price point, wouldn’t you get a much nicer apartment in much better area a little bit further north? i’d never live in any part of midtown but that’s just me.   also fuck that brokers fee wow. i have an apartment similar to this, and i'm enjoying it. i'm surprised you got to see the roof. my concern for you is the roof and the condition of the windows. do they close and lock? did a previous owners window ac warp the window frame? do they leak at all when it rains?   the best and worst part about my old rent stabilized 3 bedrooms are the windows. the sunlight is great, but it's a challenge to keep heat inside every day.  also - that brokers fee is way too high. for an old apartment like that the free should just be 1x rent. talk them down hard on the fee. no check the specific building reviews and city data on openigloo. bad reviews is a big red flag to me. unless you guys are handy, i wouldn’t move into a building where management is unresponsive it's a good apartment but 5th floor walk up? they should lower the price if it used to be a 1-bed, double check with dob the official rent. if management converted it to a 3-bedroom, and it looks shoddy, they could be charging you 3 bedroom rents assuming you'd get 2 roommates and split it. real rent for a 1-bedroom would be much lower. imo, that's not a 3-bedroom, and i would already be wary about this apartment based off that misstatement alone. midtown east or west? which cross/streets?  if it is rent-stabilized, there are limits around how much it can go up every year. size of management company doesn’t matter. i like it but i feel like you could probably get a better deal… and pay close attention to reviews. reviews are your protectors. been in too many situations that could have been avoided if i looked at reviews first… even had to sign an nda about one how bad it got to get them off my ass. i’m on the hunt and have seen about 20 apartments … this is great for the price. most buildings here are old and gonna look a little busted my friend got an apartment in williamsburg, super spacious and in a high rise for $5k. you can find something better in a nicer area. no way!!!! idk what the naysayers are on, but 3150 in midtown is a steal, especially if you see family planning in tye future. no my opinion, absolutely not. those rooms are not bedrooms. they’re connected to each other, just stay away. i like it. price seems ok for that size in the city. find out when the apartment becomes market value. lol absolutely not with that broker fee you have to look at it as a 3600 apt and for that price it’s 100% not worth it. railroad means often no real privacy and you hate 2 of your roomies. i live in brooklyn and i’m rent stabilized and pay way less for my half of a 2 bedroom.  it is possible i would say yes but it seems like you don’t like it, so, no! fuck em you’ll find something you feel right about. no if you like the bf then go there. do not take this crap apartment. you can find a better place. wow, why are you charging 5600 broker fee? i thought it was one month's rent.   i beg to differ on the ac/ laundry situation here, too. but at the same time, good luck, you don’t need to find hundreds of people to rent it. all you need is one person or a couple. always secure the cheapest rent that’s least likely to increase. 3br for $2,400 is a steal. use the savings on car service. that’s a steal. did someone get unalived there? no no leave ny please nope not at all god fuckin christ, 3150?????? i pay like $1200 for a modular home and i thought that was expensive what is a railroad apartment? great bones lmfao all i can hear now is jeff saying that thanks omg gurl run run run away you want to take over my lease? i got a nicer apartment but may be buying a house. if bf's apartment is so nice, you might consider just staying there and putting in a few thousand dollars in upgrades on your own dime. you would need to clear that with the landlord.  for the hk pad:  5th floor walk up gets old...fast, especially for moving and bringing up groceries. or if you get to the street and forgot your mobile phone.  railroad is awful with roomates. as a couple it could be fine.  the corner room is well lit and has nice windows for nyc. the kitchen and bathroom are mediocre.  hk noise and safety vary a lot. think very carefully about these factors. doesn't look that great move into the bedstuy apt with boyfriend and save yourself the 5600 broker fee wtf that is *way* more expensive than it should be. this should top out at like 2k at most is this satire? 3 roommates in a railroad? you can't be serious make sure you're in a part of bed stuy that's close to groceries and a park - that you can imagine living in 2-3 years in order to amortize out the brokers fee. if so, yeah definitely go for it. nyc is the center of the world. it'a where the money is. there are over 1 millionaires in town now, so says cnbc. this number is pre-covid, and the rich have got a lot richer since.  $3150?  that's like pennies at this level of wealth in town now.  suggestion? head over to greenpoint, you have the park, people love it there.  >new york city is home to nearly 1 million millionaires, more than any other city in the world  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/new-york-city-has-more-millionaires-than-any-other-city-in-the-world.html#:\~:text=earn-,new%20york%20city%20is%20home%20to%20nearly%201%20million%20millionaires,other%20city%20in%20the%20world&text=new%20york%20city%20is%20a,other%20city%20in%20the%20world. no. fuck no. what???  you can't just divide a couple rooms in half and call a railroad apartment a ""3 bedroom"" go to astoria or sunnyside and you'll get so much more for your budget.   your best bet might be registering your boyfriend's apartment for rent stabilization status and moving in there. this is absolutely fucking insane. move to the suburbs with that kind of budget. you would live like a king. just take the train in to work no🗣️, why not look in hoboken or edgewater in nj. yes it isn’t new work but you will find the save size apartment for half the price, with the gw bridge less than 5 minutes away! who would want to live in midtown?

169,I’m having such a hard time finding an apartment ,"fyi....the new owner must honor your current lease. you have 10 months to find a place. the owner can also pay you to move earlier, if you'd like yo your new lease is valid even if your owner sells. the new owner will be your new landlord. this works both ways, you are responsible for rent to the new landlord too. be careful about breaking your lease. i agree. i moved to astoria where there is quite a lot on the market for <$2.2k. i used to be randomly against living in queens. i thought it was “too far” from the city. but after living here for a year i absolutely love it. has all the access to restaurants/bars/bodegas etc. i would even say it has more than many parts of brooklyn. only takes me 25 minutes to get into the city (when trains are actually working lol). i find that astoria has a great “neighborhood” vibe along with all the things you would see in the city/bk.   hell, it’s even cheaper than apartments out in jersey city/hoboken. my application process was so easy. it was the first time in my 13 years of living in nyc that i didn’t have to submit a billion documents. my application was literally one or two pages long. even my lease was only a few pages long, whereas in manhattan i’ve had, like, 50 page leases [deleted] i hear you. i’ve lived here 14 years and i’ve never seen the rental market this bad. low inventory and very high prices. i’ve been looking for two months due to a ceiling leak in my current apartment. everything i’ve seen $3k and under has been disgusting. i saw a $2800 place in inwood east of broadway with mold on the walls and roach traps all over the kitchen floors that were filled with roaches.  at this point, i’m just waiting for someone else to move out of my current building so i can take their apartment. problem is, no one else is able to find a new place and move out either. q/n is my favorite line. i grew up in south brooklyn/ coney island so i always include it in my search although i’d prefer to experience other parts of brooklyn or queens.   how do you even go about finding ransoms looking to lease their space? do you just go up to those grandmother types? new york has become the city of the rich. there is no room for budget living. i'm moving next year or the year after back west. i'm sick of this shit. the new owner gets the place with you in it, with your lease in tact. you're fine. this literally happened to me in 2020, and i also stressed out over it way more than i needed too.  take a deep breath, it'll be fine i just found a place, it took me 6 weeks. there’s a shortage in apartments, especially in your price range, it hasn’t been like this in 50 years they say.   i finally found a place by working with a broker who ended up showing me a spot that hadn’t been listed, applied that day and a week later here i am.  so i suggest working with a broker, i guess in the past it was easy to find an apt in your range, which was also my range, without one, but if you’ve got the extra 15% ( some brokers just charge a 1 month rent, i saw this a lot when looking in astoria) i am paying the same for a 1 bedroom, you could try looking in bay ridge and bensonhurst bk. that's where i was seeing the most space in that budget i live in bay ridge brooklyn and my partner and i are in the process of buying a house. we close 3/15. our rent is $2,200. 2 bedrooms, dining room etc. safe neighborhood with parking. i don’t know if the landlord is going to raise the rent or not. i can keep you posted if you like. i feel you. my fiancee and i were unexpectedly displaced from a fire in a very perfect apt that's apparently way under what prices are right now. we didnt even realize how much under because we never would have thought of moving and now trying to figure out what to do im like wtf is happening and feel like i'm drowning. i'm like only able to afford the shitholes that i moved out of in my 20s i dont want to move back to that shit i was just talking about working towards having a fucking kid a week ago wtf. sent you a dm. ![gif](giphy|jzzlfxnzt4aii) there is lots of new construction in greenpoint on the east river side.  zilliow has lots of listings.  it's going to be 3k plus. that's it. no getting around it. it's nyc, the center of the world.  20 hours a week in tjs (yes even phds pick up hours there to live in nyc). that will give u enough cash to make the leap to $3,000k. after the day job. and the 1/2 dozen side hustles every new yorker is into.  maybe a 1 bedroom, and your roomate sleeps on a futon.  it's nyc, it's just number 1. it's going to cost to get the chance to have world class sushi at 1 am. and as the boys will say ""is every girl here a super model? this is  insane!""  if you want to go deeper into brooklyn, newkirk on the q gives you options.  a tree grows in brooklyn type housing, so always a grandmother that wants to rent a spare room to a ""nice girl.""  probably 1/2 of what you expect to spend. this all word of mouth, none of these spots are listed anywhere.  i'm guessing you are xx.  just have to scope out the 'hood. the q rocks!  super fast between ""the island, and brooklyn.""  good luck!  :-)  >the name ditmas park is often used as a shorthand for the several neighborhoods that comprise the larger area of [victorian flatbush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victorian_flatbush).[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ditmas_park,_brooklyn#cite_note-inserra-3)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ditmas\_park,\_brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ditmas_park,_brooklyn) you can wait in those lines that go around the block to view an apartment. or leave nyc all together. or move to philly, last i heard it just turned into south south south williamsburg though. maybe you can get paid handsomly to leave before your lease is up ?

170,How strict is the 40x income rule?,"when i moved in i also did not make the cut but i did show a statement with my savings account that had over $10k at the time and ended up letting me rent the place units in those ranges are highly competitive. nyc is competitive in general. you're up against single folks with higher incomes and couples with dual incomes. your inquiry could also just be getting buried.   set notifications on and be quick to message them well, let’s do a test if no one responds back. try leaving that information out of your initial email and see if they ask you (they will, but at least you will have contact and opportunity for feedback).  brokers did ask me before setting up a showing. i didn’t get anywhere close to my 40x though (also have over 800 credit score). saw at least 20 apartments before i found something suitable. didn’t get 2 i applied for and going into summer it’s gonna be competitive. so different managements like different things. money in the bank really plays a role we forget to mention sometimes. credit over 800 is great.   we are just at the beginning of the june market so don't freak out.  honestly i would not put your actual income in the note just write, i have great credit, qualifying income, and money in the bank.   honestly there are so many factors with reply times.   you can always add a guarantor. i will say cheaper listings tend to be smaller landlords who sometimes really like having a guarantor in on the deal, not always, but often.  honestly if someone bothers to write a note on streeteasy at all i am thankful, and answer them quickly.  i agree that low price point gets crazy competitive.   best of luck,   suzanne when i found a place i was desperate to move because it was semi reasonable and i wanted to live alone (had roommate issue). i asked my parent to be the guarantor - i was able to pay the rent but i did it just in case they passed me up for another renter. so if you find a place that you love and don’t want it to get away, it’s good to have a guarantor as a backup  edit: i was making $70k at the time and my rent was $2100 budget aside, i’ve always had more luck getting responses if i call or text the broker/landlord than if i submit my info via a website. strict. especially if it’s a coop i also didn’t make 40 x the amount when i applied for my rent stabilized place, but i had over 2 years worth of rent and utilities in my savings and a high 750+ credit score so that helped a bunch i guess. i didn’t make the cut of mine by like 10k, but b/c i had good savings and good credit, they allowed me. best tip for streeteasy: call. brokers sometimes get hundreds of inquiries for an apartment in the first few days of posting. open houses often have dozens of people. if you see a place you really like online, pick up the phone immediately. i’ll add something that may be obvious but hasn’t been mentioned. have all your paperwork together. a copy of a paystub with ytd / letter from employer stating income. a copy of your credit score. letter of reference if you have it. a copy of your id. bank statement. put this stuff in a pdf so you can email it to the broker as soon as you make a decision. some people even print it out and put it in a report cover and take it with them when they look at places. it will help you be the first applicant over the finish line. if you have all of your financial statements and tax returns in hand, you should be okay! what helped me was a landlord reference letter too you seem to have great financials, i would just be weary about any coops. some are stricter than others in any case you’ll definitely get approved on your price point. 1. don't just message. e-mail then call. most brokers have listed numbers. 2. if you have a lot of savings assets, that can help with units that are right at 40x. a friend of mine who barely met 40x requirement and limited credit history (so didn't even have credit score)  was able to easily clear the requirement by showing he had years worth of rent saved up. 3. if your looking at anywhere that you don't meet 40x, expect them to ask for a  guarantor. its strict. pretty strict don't sell short the income amount you're stating.  not sure how you're verifying it, but try to just show 1 paystub & project to yearly, rather than yearly tax return. if have to show the latter, have your dad give you 20k tax free gift dec 31, immediately turn around & jan 1 give back to your mom.  a. if you're saying 85 because you receive 1700 weekly, there's 52 weeks & 1 day in a year- 2 days this leap year, so 52.4 (2 days is .4 of 5 day workweek) = $89+k, 90+ if pay is actually $1,7xx.   b. add a dollar value to all your benefits for higher fig- discounted transit pass, anything. it's the same as if instead employer paid out allowance for employee to then pay health plan, gym, etc. themselves.   b. any expenses they're reimbursing you for add to total #.  you should now be at ~100k. you could even state 110-120k and say side gigs make up the rest- under 5k won't get 1099 from this year, 1 weekend day per week at famous aitalian eatery off the books...   good luck. for me, it was an iron clad requirement. i didn’t get approved until i got a job that was over 40x the rent by $1000. even being exactly at 40x doesn’t look good. also i recommend not overpaying for rent, it’s painful. utilities might add $300-$400 to your payment you will be spreading yourself thin. keep in mind, if you have an “electric” apt your con ed bill can be $300 in the winter. everything including water/stove etc runs on electric, so keep that in mind. i remember when i got my 1st apt i was in shock about that and at $85k/yr, u could be over extending. good luck! don’t say your income. i always just say “i’m over 40x rent” i think you will find something, but as a landlord i'd be more comfortable with someone who isn't at the top of their budget. if it's a competitive listing you are likely to lose out to someone who has a higher income and more cushion unless you are able to appeal to them on a personal or practical level (ex: good amount of savings in bank, stable employment, etc.). it’s a rule of thumb. if your below the 40x but not by much other aspects of your application can offset it. in my place i was like 30x so they were considering another applicant but i had maintained a large balance on my bank account for months that they figured i was good for the money (which i am i paid rent in time and soon had a raise to be over the 40x limit) check out neighborhoods like woodhaven - they’re often overlooked but really well situated it depends.  nyc is very competitive but also you sometimes get landlords/rental companies who are willing to negotiate. my first solo apartment in nyc was in a more expensive area of brooklyn and was right at the top of my budget.  i was making ~$100k and rent was $2400 a month, and i had pretty good credit in the mid 700s (this was in 2017).  the renal company agreed to rent to me if i agreed to pay first month and last two months of rent up front. be willing to negotiate and you should find something decent. photoshop june move in? youre still 'early'  don't freak out yet. most people don't find places until the last two weeks of the month it’s fine if you submit fake paystubs and w2s. most landlords will not do any kind of due diligence, and if they do, the worst that can happen is that you don’t get the apartment. it’s a stupid requirement, so don’t worry too much about finding creative ways to circumvent it. very.  always had to meet that requirement (sometimes 80x w/ my hubby - depends on the place) it’s a rule of thumb. if your below the 40x but not by much other aspects of your application can offset it. in my place i was like 30x so they were considering another applicant but i had maintained a large balance on my bank account for months that they figured i was good for the money (which i am i paid rent in time and soon had a raise to be over the 40x limit) june is a really tough time to find a place. summer inventory tends to be tight since everyone’s moving then. depends on size of landlord and locations. some are desperate for tenants.  other couldn't give af. depends on the management company. the solution that they offer is the guarantors which is lease insurance for the management company that you purchase. it’s roughly the cost of a months rent. the deal is it only covers the lease period. and has to be purchased again when you renew your lease. i’m sure it’s different from place to place but my apartment building does not go month to month…it’s one lease term then another lease. i did a 1yr, then a 18mo, and just redid for 15mo. another note is the lease periods i chose were the max that i could get at the time. i’m also moving in june if you need a roommate. got an apartment showing barely 40x rent but showed lots of assets. ime very strict. income omg! how does one get a credit score over 800?! mine is high but that's insane. only person i know with that earns over 7 figures and owns companies are you applying for studios ? because that’s mostly what you’re looking at in queens for 2000-2100. it’s getting kind of crazy even in queens with rent rn . some are switching to 52x, so take from that what you will. some landlords will hold you to the exact #, some will be flexible, some will take things like excellent credit, and money into the bank into consideration and be flexible, others won't. really just depends on what landlord you get and how flexible they do or not want to be very idk what all these people are talking about. it's not strict at all. you ask an agent/broker and they'll tell you that strict the 40x requirement is really just to weed people out. 30x is the actual number that they care about. under 30x and you're not getting it like a pimp asking b!tch better have my money. never live in the top of your budget apartments.   try to live in apartments that are 28% or lower of your gross income my friend went through some run around and literally sent a pic of her credit score (also over 800) and got a call back right away. strict in luxury/doorman buildings, corporate run entities. you're fucked. this city is fucked. good luck!!! i know it may not be possible for everyone but if you show up with 4-5 months rent in cash they never turn you down why are you still living in nyc?? get out. i did, you will be better off and start enjoying life again. have you told the brokers to get real jobs and stop being leeches?  that might help get a response. 40 x rent is not the right calculation, assuming you have no other debts like cc, student loan, auto loan.  you have to know what you can afford or what other expenses, besides your rent.  for me, 80k a year is tight income for 2k rent unless you have extra saving to show that you have at least 3 months of emergency fund. why people making only $85k would spend 2k on rent? this always baffles me. when i was making this much my rent was $500",104,104,neutral,0.5296160578727722,208,"but had a lot of savings and the 40x requirement, don't worry. you can always add a guarantor if you have it. i've had success with a coop and i would recommend that you apply for anything that you don't meet the 40x requirement. i would also suggest that you apply for anything that is under 40x. i've had success with a coop and i"
171,How is this legal?,"i toured this apartment earlier this week. the next day it was reposted on zillow, under a different broker and with a different address. the actual address 390 vernon, so none of the listings are correct. i sent my application to the first broker and never heard back. i reached out to the second broker and explained what happened and they wouldn’t help me. they told me the first application would be fine, but i have never heard back. i hate how even housing has become so laden with scams 😞 it's so demoralizing. hope you find something real soon!! a lot of places post stock photos as these places go so fast.  could be bait and switch or just that the price is low  and will be grabbed up there are tons of buildings on streeteasy who repost the same apartment’s photos for multiple (similar) units. unfortunately you wont know what they actually look like until you see them in person. if these are legit (which they easily might not be), the more expensive ones are likely nicer. after i signed my apartment they relisted the apartment on streeteasy for $600 more, i think sometimes they do it so they can say it rented for more than it actually did to drive up the price of the market. the broker who rents in my building regularly does this. he posts. takes it down. reposts under a different apartment number and a different price. i reported it to streeteasy and they actually deleted a number of his listings. i feel like i need to get into the scam business… is there anything really stopping these people? i’m tired of being at the bottom of the pile if something smells fishy, it probably is (though you have to decide the degree of fishiness you're willing to entertain). sorry you’re finding out how awful property managers etc are in brooklyn. best of luck. i know it sucks. bet they asked for a crazy deposit do you want an apartment with bucket or without bucket? because the landlord’s control everything so you’ll put up with the constant bait and switch game they play because if you don’t some twink from the midwest gladly will. idk where you’re looking for a place but talk to amorelli realty they’re good they got me my place quickly and didn’t play with the price nimby landlords also hire multiple brokers i can speak for everyone but it is usually individuals who are of this mentality not a whole company and or group",100,31,negative,0.7904438972473145,131,they were honest and didn’t play with the price i was lucky to get it and they got me in fast i would recommend them to anyone. it is. it is usually individuals and not. it is usually individuals who are of this mentality and or group. it is usually individuals. not companies. brokers. brokers. brokers.... applied to.. never never never never?.
172,NY is in the top 10 slowest-selling metros,"try to buy a co-op, which is 70ish% of all nyc inventory, and you will understand what i am seeing is places with tech industry seem to be slow (given all the lay offs). nyc should be in the 10 slowest. condos/co-ops don't appreciate as much as single family housing and buying one almost never makes sense from a financial perspective. the reason people do it is they value price stability or a sense of security, but as an investment it makes almost no sense.

173,To Live in Jersey saving or to Live in NYC spending more,"make the move. i lived alone on that salary in a 1bed in east village. managed to save a fair amount while still going out on weekends, taking vacations, etc. being near your friends & people you care about is priceless.   as long as you don’t spend frivolously (and it doesn’t sound like you do), you’ll be just fine. maybe you don’t do constant bottles at the club, but if you’re genuinely concerned about saving, you probably don’t do that anyway! i think nyc is a no brainer. you couldn't pay me enough money to live in jersey when my entire life is in nyc. you'll save less, but have a more full life. at the age of 25 you are doing above and beyond already. don’t wait till in the 35+ then to “worry” but seems like you’ve got a good career path. also moving to manhattan is not a permanent decision, sign a one year contract see how things go and reserve for the expenses and i’m sure you’re safe on that aspect. once your 25 is gone your 30 is coming very soon. enjoy yourself and perhaps moving somewhere else. $130k and single you’re good. i can’t say that if you have kids. there are studios in chelsea at 3k and under according to streeteasy. not as easy as living in the financial district for your commute, but not horrible. how are the jersey city rent prices rn? could be worth it since your office is right there. plenty of people live in that city and spend all their free time in manhattan live in the city for sure and at your age stop funding the family, you’ll be in a better position to do so when you’re older. sounds kinda pointless to move to nyc if you work in jc. more taxes, more rent. why not move to downtown jc or hoboken? the path can take you to wtc in 1-2 stops. that could easily get you studio in manhattan but you could also find a studio or 1b1b for as much as you're paying now in bk or queens. a lot of advice, where they say don't live in jersey because it's jersey, or go live in bk/queens because it's nyc is not in good faith and only to dunk on jersey for some weird reason. don't derive your net worth from your zip code like those losers.      how much does money matter ? for your income, there's roughly 2% in state tax + additional city tax which is \~3.5%. it should be 6-7k which is 6k/50 = 130 late night cab rides a year if you chose to live in nj and took a cab everytime you had to come home late. there's so much more, like sales tax on everything, cost of almost everything is more etc. factor in 700-800 increase in the budget atleast (since you'll still be paying for path for commute to work).  1. what neighborhoods are you going to go more often ? i tend to stick to more west side, and for me,  jersey city is much closer and comfortable commute than bk/queens to west village).  2. how many times do you go out a week ? ( if you go out more twice m-f and come back later than 11 a lot, definitely live in the city)  3. do you go into work or can can chose work from home most of the time ? (you can cut on the commute time).  4. comfortable living with roommates ? it opens a lot more options and it's fun when you're young.     hell's kitchen and fidi will probably be the best bet for you if you chose to live in the city. at your age and salary i would say def take the leap and live in nyc, especially if you already have savings and a good income you expect to stay the same or increase over time. your income won’t get you as luxurious of an apt as it could in nj but i think you’ll find you get used to a more basic apt pretty quickly. you’ll also spend a lot less time in it!   my biggest advice is get more serious about budgeting. it’s probably relatively simple to make the $$$ work now, and have savings and fun money leftover every month. you should really look at how much you absolutely need every month after rent, and factor in that things like groceries and toiletries are more expensive here too. i make 60k less than you do and i live alone in a studio in bk and make it work just fine, with the help of a budgeting app!   and keep in mind it’s pretty common to move a lot here—there have been 3-4 years in a row i’ve moved every year. if your first apt sucks, you’ll know what to look for and can upgrade, you aren’t stuck in one place. good luck! i think factor in the increased grocery prices, sales tax, tips, federal and state taxes other than apartment. feel like u would be saving a good 700-1000 per month more in jersey. and while i am saying this i will also say i am in nyc. i don’t have too many friends, but i like roaming around alone. though i would have liked to have friends but i can’t make them fast enough. also dating is shit in nyc for average folks who don’t know dating profile branding 😂 i’m doing this exact same thing! it’s more important to live near my life than my job now ~ it’s going to cost more but i’ve reworked my budget to something i’m comfortable with to make it happen! i’m tired of the amount of time i waste with the path as part of my transportation 😵‍💫 this is so funny because i go through this constant opposite battle for myself with wanting to move to jersey city from brooklyn! i live in a new building, in a 1st floor, 1000 square ft duplex apartment for 3.1k a month and despite me being able to afford it, i do wish i could luck up on a cheaper spacious apartment but it never really seems that realistic. plus, this is like the perfect apartment for me, but also...there are cheaper options...but also...the convenience of living here and i love living in flatbush near prospect park. ultimately i probably will be staying in my apartment!  not sure if location is a huge thing for you, but in my building there is a duplex next door to me being cleaned out and probably on the market sometime soon for probably in the same price range. it's a 1 bed 1.5 bath duplex like mine but a different layout, but not sure if living in manhattan is a huge deal for you. rent in hoboken or jc, the views are better and all the rest is the same minus the city tax i moved from nyc to jersey city and love it. where are you living? if youre close to exchange or grove its pretty much the same commuting distance to go out as people who live in uws, ues, east village, etc (assuming you go out on the west side - west village, soho, etc) my friends all live in manhattan but most ppl go out in wv or soho so its easy to get to. do not move to anywhere that is not manhattan that makes no sense. if you work at exchange can live in fidi, or if near newport then can look at living along 33rd st line. is your social life in manhattan? then living in jersey city is your best bet. it’s faster/easier to get into manhattan from jc than queens/brooklyn on weekend cause you’re not dealing with mta.   if your social life is in brooklyn then live in brooklyn but your commute will suck.   you can also try living with roommates if you want to live in downtown manhattan cause that’s the only place with path. anywhere else will make your commute miserable do it for a few years while you’re still young! no, it’s not the financially logical thing to do, but how much do joy and experiences cost? do it if you live off the l train it does directly transfer to the path at 6th ave - from the first few stops in bk it’s only about a 15 min ride - could expand your search radius a bit! i mean, just a suggestion: wouldn't living in newport, exchange place, or hoboken offer you the best of both worlds?  i think along with the tax savings, getting into the city from those locations is relatively painless. i’d opt to move closer to nyc without moving there. it’s such a downgrade in terms of living standards here. pay is great but majority of it gets eaten up by high rent, below average living standards, and much more. happy to see so many “i wouldn’t live in new jersey” folks in here, keeps the rent a little lower in jc.  in the contrary, my partner and i (in our 20s) live in jc (near exchange place) and our life (both work, go out on weekends and have friends) is in nyc and you couldn’t pay me to move back. you can find barebones one bedrooms for your current budget in lower manhattan right now.  you’re 25, you can do without a dishwasher for a few years in favor of being close to socializing.  you’re only young and stupid enough to make crazy cool memories for about another 3-5 years, tops.  you will have the rest of your life to live in nj once you hit 30 and want to settle down. make friends in jersey jersey city and take the path when u want to be in the city. or try to find a decent rental in the astoria/lic area, rest of queens. but factor in commute times. under 30 single male = nyc  over 30 single male = cooked move to nyc, maybe an ny job to match 😏 at 25 just do it. yes your apartment is going to suck, yes you’re going to save less, but try it out for 2+ years and see how it goes. you can spend your older decades in nj. we only live once, just move to the city. as someone who used to live in jc, nobody ever would come to me, i always had to go into the city.  i realize that’s not everyone’s experience though.  maybe try to find a place that’s not far from the path to make things easier for yourself if possible. you're still really young. just stick with the roommate situation. get a roommate in nyc. you can live in a nice place and live in manhattan. you’re 25 and single. you’ve had roommates for 8 years…lol college doesn’t count.  the easiest place in the world to have a roommate is nyc - you can get out of your apt to do a million things and roommates are usually not around all the time. find a roommate who works in finance 80 hours a week haha if you decide you want to stay in jersey, i would suggest looking into weehawken. one of the most underpriced and underrated city adjacent towns in my opinion.  - shorter commute to midtown manhattan, then hoboken or jersey city - much cheaper than hoboken or jersey city - awesome waterfront parks and rec facilities  - no night life like hoboken or jersey city but maybe that’s what some people / families want i think the real problem here is the ongoing classist/mental illness that is nyc population hating on nj. of course i admit i like nyc more than nj but that does not make anyone living in nj some sort of inferior being. op confesses finding a partner is hard because he lives in nj. like that is the reason. nj could be closer than brooklyn or queens. nj could be closer than other parts of manhattan. the stigma that surrounds it in the city is obnoxious. to think you might find the love of your life at a bar in the city one night. but then the person confesses to living in nj and you feel too superior and shut them off. no you’ll say. the distance. it would never work. but yet for some reason it is better to date someone from li and that is hella further, usually. nyc just get over yourself it is 2024 and people just don’t care about you like before.  ,and the last comment, yes of course people still move there want to be there. like always and (hopefully) forever. but outside nyc. it’s like everyone has been. everyone knows. or everyone goes several times a year because they have to. it’s not some mythical secret place that only actors actresses and rich people are or go. the secret is out the jig is up. it’s a big city. but yes i do love it too bro was really paying 2.5k a month with a roommate in jersey city 💀 i regret moving to jersey city from brooklyn- hate it here. if i was a little younger with no obligations i would definitely choose nyc over jersey. dm me if you are looking for a roommate also around a similar price point check out 2 gold in fidi. studios are ~$3,500 and it’s a short walk up fulton to the oculus live in nyc and try to find an aptmnt in the off cycle, fall and winter so you escape peak nyc rent prices. absolutely move into the city. if anything do it for a year and if find yourself spending too much or not liking it go back to jersey i had to make this decision and opted for jersey city, journal square area. about me: i wfh, i have a small dog, 26f.  i go in to manhattan 3-5 times a week to do things and see friends. it’s actually not a bad commute to the wtc it takes you 30+ min, west village about 35. for me i wanted to save on taxes (again i wfh), have my own private studio in a very nice and new building. so far my friends that do care about me have made the trek and actually liked the neighborhood and my building.  you can community build in nyc while living in jersey city. and i looked and some places in brooklyn and the studios i saw were way smaller and it would take me an hour to get to the west village which is where in primarily go out. biggest downside is taking the path at night which sometimes you have to wait 30-40 min for the next one. where about in nj do you live? you could check jersey city or hoboken to maybe save a little $ in the apartment and be just a path ride away from nyc. write down what you want in a place and then look in both in nyc and jersey. find a few places and then see which one you see yourself in. good luck! could also try looking for the job in the city instead. live in the city. what’s your definition of a decent commute? also, i just looked on streeteasy within your budget a ton of things popped up in north west brooklyn (park slope, boreum hill, brooklyn heights, dumbo, downtown etc) which isn’t too far from fidi to catch the path. you have a lot of options, you’ll be alright going through the exact same thing (27f) and honestly thinking it’s worth just paying to live in the uws more than staying in jersey city, for me. it takes longer to get anywhere, the path isn’t always reliable, dating is harder and all my friends are in the city. it just sucks going from the luxury buildings, bigger apartments, affordable groceries and safety but it’s worth the trade off for me. good luck! i make a similar amount and managed to find a studio in manhattan for $2500. it’s not a luxury building by any means - but it was completely gutted and renovated with new floors/bathroom/kitchen/appliances/etc. and i was the first person to rent my unit post renovation. so the cleanliness / modernness is pretty good for its cost.   so i say definitely look for some places. with your budget, if you can find a roommate, can easily find a nice luxury building with amenities (probably in the cheaper areas like near hells kitchen or midtown east. can you not use the 6k for cabs and continue living in jc? or you can explain what specifically is bothering you about the travel to manhattan. because imo better to live in jc rather than hamilton heights or bk.   i personally made the move from uws to jc (both luxury buildings) and have had no issues of such kind maybe because i am ok taking cabs on the way back during times when the path is unreliable. perhaps this is a dumb question but you can't find a job in nyc? understandable if not, i just think it solves your problems if you want to live here---there are so many jobs in manhattan.  nah, but if you want to keep your job and live here just go for it. if it doesn't work out you can always move back to jersey. i make 90k per year and own my own apartment in uptown manhattan with a mortgage of $1100 and maintenance fees of $450, i'm sure at 130k you can find something that's the right fit near the path. maybe it won't be luxury (and i think with your wishes to not making any unwise financial decisions it shouldn't be) but in chinatown you can still find weird yet somewhat affordable apartments and then you're not so far from the path. look everywhere obviously, but i say go for it if all your friends are here and you want to be in the action.  hope you find what works for you. move to nyc. i was in jc for 5 years, made the move about a year and a half ago, and it was honestly life altering.  you say you’re 25 and single, so i’m going to assume you date. a lot of nyc people won’t date a jersey person…. you’ll find your dating pool is going to expand. i make more than you, but i have more expenses (i kept my car, it’s in a deck in jersey city) and i do fine and have savings. don’t feel pressured to join the fanciest gym or always have the best of the best and it’s workable. one thing people don’t consider are the added taxes. nyc income tax is a bear. and if you work in nj and love in ny i believe you pay income tax in both states. just another expense to consider. pay up.  when i lived in ny i lived in manhattan.  i was fnancially responsible for just myself and young enough to not care if i lived on air.   the lighting on the busses and subways was so dismal and depressing that i walked most places and at all hours.  i can not fathom taking the path after a fun night.  you will find new ways to be financually responsible. hoboken is for you i make 13 an hour… idk how people who makes over six figures complains so much everyone i know wants to get the heck out of ny. i and they grew up here. i'm stuck with a rent controlled apartment and can't afford anything else. this place is a well ... it sucks you in you only live once. don’t do it in new jersey. for how much youre willing to pay, downtown and the trendy brooklyn neighborhoods are not possible (if you want more than barebones) i would say ues would be it to get a nice 1 bd under $2800 but is that worth moving to? software engineer in gs jersey city? i will say to keep in mind that nyc has a city income tax, so factor that into your budget. i make a bit less than you at 100k and i live in a 1 bed in brooklyn for 2200. i’m breaking even most months, it’s not ideal, and i’m not a big going out person. track all of your spending you as long as you can before you start to look so you have a realistic idea of your spending sure but none of your hinge/bumble/feeld dates will like this. like none. zero. null come to nyc, all your life 🧬 in nyc what you are doing ❤️ n jersey, every using the path and i think the cost in s around 150$   and time, just move to nyc asap, meet new friends and find the one what is your work? move to the city brother. if having a nice place is your number one priority than allocate a little more towards your home and spend some extra time looking for a good deal. i’m relatively new here as well, and before moving to manhattan i spent a month in jc and a month in bushwick. i actually ended up spending more on late night ubers, food takeout, car rentals etc while being outside manhattan. now i walk or subway to 99% of the things, and don’t feel out of place. also don’t forget the motivation and inspiration the city gives you to push yourself further. if you really want to, you have a lot of room to grow in terms of salary etc, and a closer network of successful people will always be better than not. good luck! why not move to nyc and get a roommate?   you could spend what you expected and get a nicer place eg 6-6.5k for a nice 2 bed or 5k for a less nice 2 bed. i’d also consider looking for a new job that pays more and nyc based or remote. they exist. when i lived in brooklyn, i had a job out in hoboken and the commute was literally killing me (a cab to the path, path to the subway, subway to a different subway line) because it was an hour fourty five each way.  it was literally slowly killing me because of how much extra time was dedicated to travel.    so with that, you probably would want to move super close to the path or nj transit.  i think while you’re young, it’s ok to want to be where your fun is, as long as the commute itself doesn’t wreck you. if you’re patient and persistent you can find something close to the l train in brooklyn that would make your commute reasonable and come in under budget even. you’d be in a good spot that’s probably easily accessible to all the places you wanna go. no one will visit you in jersey (and everything you’re gonna want to do is in nyc) $3k-3.2k rent on $130k gross if you like going out and “traveling” (idk what that entails, $5k a year or $10k a year on trips) will be tough if you want to put anything significant in investments or savings. i’ve lived in jc for over three years now - i’m the same age as you and in a very similar situation (definitely like it over here, but also love the city and most of my social life is over there). i’ve seriously thought (and started to plan at times) moving over to manhattan even though my job is based in north jersey (currently mostly remote). i think this is really a case of pros vs. cons for you as you seem to be in a great financial position, but i wanted to add that my social life started to change over here once i finally started putting myself out there and doing things that i enjoy even if it was alone at first. the gym, i’ll go sit at a bar alone, bumble bff (though i’m a woman, don’t think men use that lol) - i’ve met so many younger people in jc that i now consider great friends from this if that’s one of your big concerns. always down for more friends if you’d like to chat and end up staying over here :) get a new roommate in nyc. as a jersey girl myself i will advocate for you staying near your social network! how much are you spending on transportation to the city each month? i did the math when i first moved here and it made sense to just live in the city since my office is here. taxes are inevitable and will continue to increase everywhere. so if i were you, i would just live the life you actually want rather than looking at it from across the river. job hunt for a job in nyc.   spend time on streeteasy looking at places in your range. get a sense of what is possible. i wouldn’t pay $3k for a studio no. but i also wouldn’t live in new jersey try long island city. i think there’s a path train connection midtown and the commute from lic to midtown is not bad. i too moved from jersey to lic a few years ago and loved lic!! at 25 you will still be single until your mid 30’s. nyc dating culture / getting serious stage starts around early 30’s so i don’t think dating will improve by moving. nyc is a cult; get new friends which option is best for your mental health?   typically, being close to good people and stress reduction that comes with decreased commute outweighs saving more $. but i’m not sure if you’re trying to pay down debt and need that extra $ etc  if nyc is better for your mental health, you have your answer.   also, and this is the dreamer part speaking: you’re 25! enjoy life where you want to live. you may not be unattached forever—be a young man living it up in the city if that’s what you want nyc. why would you want to live in the dirty jerz a studio’s cool but you could honestly get a super cute 1bdr with great amenities for 3k  my bf and i are paying 3.8k total for a nice 2bdr 2ba in a really nice part of bk you can get a nice one bedroom in queens for less than 3k.

174,Landlord charging $1300 for wall damage,"make him document why it costs that much ( it doesn’t) in writing there's no negotiating.  i wouldn't pay a dime for that.  it's a simple patch and the other one is sanding and new paint.  it all falls under normal wear and tear. oddly enough, my family is repainting a 900 sf apartment (in the same color) and received a “this guy has no insurance” quote of $3000 and a “this guy has a company” quote of $5000. for tenants in units that are not rent stabilized or rent controlled, the landlord must return the security deposit within 14 days of the tenant moving out.  if they plan to deduct any expenses they must send an itemized “receipt” for what they plan to deduct within the 14 days. if they don’t then they must return the entire deposit. tbh you coulda just fixed it but idk take him to small claims court fix it yourself just fix it yourself. super easy small patch job to do. you can watch a video on how to do it if u need it’s a 1 hour job max… heres a hint: compound (blue top) and plaster mixrure (add water but not too much), then use a normal spatula for christs sake. after that, let it dry or use a heatgun / hairblower, sand it and paint it.  sincerely a cycle painter there's a difference between damage and wear/tear.  in most states, you can't be charged for filling holes and painting ask him to provide an itemized receipt from the company he’s using depends on what they plan to do.  i'm doing something similar right now.  tenant punched the door and cracked the wood left a big dent on a door after arguing with a girlfriend.  material set me back $130.  paint, semi gloss, brushes, roller, paint pan, paper towel, sand paper, sanding block, and ladder.  spackling and waiting about 6 hours to dry and sand the door.  before applying 2 coats of paint.  not to mention they left screw holes in the 2 walls.  spackling and drying doesn't take too long.  but you have to repaint the whole wall to make it look right.  so basically about 11 hours spent from start to finish.  so what is my time worth.  i usually just do 3x material.  so about $390 off the deposit.  now if your landlord hired someone.  no one is leaving their house for less than $500 plus material ($130).  he doubles that for his coordination efforts.  that's $1260 right there. just out of curiosity is this apt off davis st in lic? my gf and roommate at the time also got charged an outrageous fee but they were able to fight it. [deleted] how long after you moved out did they tell you this? they're required to give you a written, itemized receipt as well as any unused security deposit within 14 days of you vacating. i just dealt with this myself and fortunately, my ex-landlord was smart enough to capitulate.  the law requires the following steps be taken in order for us to have an opportunity to remedy any perceived issues with the premises:  1. landlord shall notify tenant in writing of right to request inspection of premises prior to vacating, and to be present during the inspection. (section 7-108(d)) 2. inspection shall be no later than 1 week before end of tenancy (section 7-108(d)) 3. landlord shall provide 48 hours written notice of date and time of inspection (section 7-108(d)) 4. after inspection, landlord shall provide tenant with itemized statement specifying repairs or cleaning (section 7-108(d)).     1. tenant shall have the opportunity to cure any such condition before the end of tenancy (section 7-108(d)) 5. ""within fourteen days after the tenant has vacated the premises, the landlord shall provide the tenant with an itemized statement indicating the basis for the amount of the deposit retained, if any, and shall return any remaining portion of the deposit to the tenant. **if a landlord fails to provide the tenant with the statement and deposit within 14 days, the landlord shall forfeit any right to retain any portion of the deposit***.""* (section 7-108(e)) 6. ""any person who violates the provisions of this subdivision shall be liable for actual damages, provided a person found to have willfully violated this subdivision **shall be liable for punitive damages up to twice the amount of the deposit or advance**."" (section 7-108(g)) the fact of the matter is the security deposit is meant to secure the tenant returns the apartment in the exact.same.condition it was in when they first moved in. normal  and tear is considered a couple scratches and scuffs, staining, and small.holes.in the wall.smaller.than a quarter size. anything beyond.that is coming out of.your security deposit, but the ll has to say something about it before that 14 days is up. it's up to the outgoing tenant to.request the walkthrough on the day they vacate so they don't get any surprises and can document anything that comes up so they know what needs to be remedied and what to look for in an itemized bill when the ll says it's going to cost this much. i don't understand how  certain people think it's ok to use someone else's property, damage it, and then expect  to nickle and dime the owner over the damages they made. it's just like renting a car... 100% they just gonna pocket the money and paint over it anyways. watch a youtube video. buy materials for under 25 dollars and do that shit yourself.   your landlord will have to find someone else to fuck over with that bullshit. they are required to repaint the apartment anyway.  that is not damage; it is just everyday use, which will be fixed with the coat of paint they must give before they can sign a new lease. threaten to take them to small claims court.  you're entitled to double of whatever they withold. thats normal wear and tear.  you shouldnt have to pay anythting. you have an opportunity to repair it yourself.  find a handyman to do it for a few hundred.  paint is wear and tear so should not be a factor. as a previous landlord the prices for everything has gone up. a gallon of paint is $25 (2-3 gallons per room) and the painter that was 300 a room is now 600. you can’t paint one wall so you have to do the whole room. $1300 might seem high but it is definitely possible. drywall is fucking expensive bro. condo owner here—i have to replace about 25 sq feet of drywall and it’s costing me 5 figures. you probably should have fixed it yourself. normal wear and tear.  we just had a tenant move out nail holes everywhere.  damage to all the painted cabinets.  she was there for not even 2 years. it cost 18k to paint the apartment. just curious is 1300 dollars your whole deposit? landlords literally share tips on how to scam tenants out of their deposits. many times the landlord already spent the money this is why i always patch any holes when leaving an apartment. even a thumb tack hole. costs a lot less to do it yourself find someone that can fix it for less than $100. they're everywhere. people who can do this in their sleep. landlords like that are just trying to get ahead by getting over on someone & that's not the answer to life. do not pay that bullshit amount. he's an idiot. if you haven't pay, i'd ignore him and move on with real life. leave em to drown in their own delusion. did you move out already? if not fix the wall damage why not fix it yourself. will cost you less than $50 that's why i do this shit myself. people be charging insane dumb prices. get a friend who knows how to repair it, or go to where day laborers hang out for work and show picture of it, they'll do it for you gor a price. my landlords tried the same thing but $1200, i fixed it myself and they cut it down to $600, then i sent a detailed write up with images before and after, saying that it is outrageous and i would sue…we settled at $40 after that was brought up lol. the damage quote is not entirely outrageous, it is def high for the type of damage thats showing in the picture.  however as a gc and painter in nyc for the past 30 yrs.  its not uncommon for landlords or property management to charge these prices.  for those saying this is an easy fix, you are right… if you have the experience.  i would charge the landlord at least $500-600 for this job.  spot painting even with the same exact paint will not work.  you would have to patch, sand, prime and paint the entire section of that wall, if not the entire wall.  that being said, it could take at least 2-3 days to finish between coats and whatnot.  $250 a day for a painter is about the going rate these days in ny.  so thats already $750 in labor.  materials going to run around $150… thats $80 for a gal of paint, $45 for primer, then the rest in sanding block, compound, tape (if needed), joint knife, etc.    $1500 is high as ive mentioned but around $1000 is normal if hiring professionals. in 2024 it’s not outrageous to be honest.  you can call a plumber to snake a toilet and you are north of $600.  the wording of the lease is also paramount - there should be a restoration/damage repair clause within the document if they used a decent template.  unfortunately it’s unlikely that you will feel like you have “won” at the end of the day.  the cost to fight this in court would also be prohibitive… you can fix it yourself go home depot how was the finish on the wall? if it was level 3 skim coat or so then the whole wall needs to be done... you had the opportunity to patch those yourself before you left. you didn't and now you have to pay the landlord tax.   that's how it works. 👍 that’s because he’s changing that entire panel who wants to see patches paying that kind of rent? if you created the damages you must pay for them,it’s for the panels and the labor.he cannot charge that kind of rent with patched walls it looses value will require the entire wall to be painted over to look symmetrical, so will likely run you back about $6-700 in total with labor. or $200 in material and a day or 2 of your time. i think some people in here may be misleading you a bit. either fix it yourself or exclaim he needs to charge you a fair price for this and you should be good good for him, pay attention next time. [deleted] $1300 is a reasonable cost for that repair. your landlord needs to repaint the entire wall. next time, be more careful with other people's property.",96,142,neutral,0.6133325695991516,238,landlord for actual damages**. **any person found to have willfully violated this subdivision for actual damages**. **shall for actual damages**. i would never pay for a patch job. it's a simple patch and the other one is sanding and new paint. i would never pay for a patch job. i would pay for a patch job. i would pay for a patch job. i

176,How can this city be considered tenant friendly?,"that nyc is considered tenant-friendly says more about the near-absolute power that landlords in most of the rest of the country enjoy than it says about nyc. if you look at it that way then it makes more sense. it’s only “tenant friendly “ in that we don’t allow landlords to evict without going to court. thats it. nyc and ny in whole are “tenant” friendly…. once you become a tenant.  when you are a tenant and late w rent, you can’t be served a min 15 day rent demand till the 6th of the month.   in land lord friendly states, if rent isn’t paid on the 1st, you can get a 3 day notice of eviction on the 2nd of the month and have the marshal at your door on the 5th of the month w all ur stuff on the sidewalk before the week is over.   in landlord friendly states, you need a lot less in your application because it’s easier to evict.  you need a lot more in your application to get an apartment in ny because it’s sooo much harder to kick someone out. min 75 days, more likely 90 + days. trust me on that one once you’re in a unit, if you’re willing to suffer the consequences, it’s really hard to evict you. you can run a trap house, completely destroy the place, stop paying rent. it’ll still take years to get you out. once you finally appear, the judge will have zero sympathy.  that’s part of why landlords are such assholes to everyone else. just part though. most of it is greed.  the reason less “tenant-friendly” areas don’t have *as* insanely and pervasively abusive landlords (not saying much) is because people have options and can leave. here we’re stuck with what we’ve got. [deleted] i think it’s “tenant friendly” in that it’s really hard to get evicted so once you have a place, you have a place. but because it’s hard to evict, landlords are gonna make it exceedingly hard to get a place at all your points about nyc are correct, but if you looked at many other cities and towns across the state, you'd see that even on paper tenants have fewer rights.  also because so many across the economic spectrum rent here, there isn't a big division between ""renters"" and ""homeowners"" that you'll see in other places where ""renters"" are thought of as a distinct class of ne'er do wells.  we might not live up to our ideals here, but at least we have actual laws that protect people from unscrupulous practices. the laws are very tenant friendly. 1/3 of households are rent stabilized. even if you’re not, evictions take years to process in court  the rental market is terrible so landlords have all the power. that’s because the supply of units is very low compared to demand so the vacancy rate is 1-2%. so tenants have a lot of legal power but no economic bargaining power, and the laws transfer all the costs from rs tenants to non-rs tenants.  and the supply is low because the government has many zoning and regulations that make it very very difficult to build new units. it took 10 years for gowanus to get rezoned to allow more housing construction.   we are 500k-1 million units short compared to demand.  it’s like living in a place that bans new farms but claims food is a human right. people are still gonna go hungry you have to get a prostate exam because you're buying life insurance.  ie once you're in its very hard to get you out it's kinda like unions. once you're in, it's really hard to get you out. it has the side effect of making it very hard to get in, because landlords are terrified of what you can do if you you know the law and are willing to use it to your advantage.   as others have pointed out, if you don't care about the consequences, you can seriously ruin the landlords day (or rather, year+). if it's a small landlord, you can do even worse. it means they will do everything in their power and then some to minimize the risk though. including making sure your prostate is healthy. buy an investment apartment, rent it then take the tenant to court for non payment then circle back here and tell us how nyc is not tenant friendly i work in property management on the city and came from the west. this is not a tenant friendly city, you had to plant roots a long time ago. that being said, 311 and the ability to look up reported building issues, is amazing. nyc is considered tenant friendly, especially within the past few years, due to two major laws that passed.  the housing stability and tenant improvement act of 2019, which, amongst other things, makes it nearly impossible to convert a rent stabilized apartment to free market, and, the good cause eviction law that passed on 4/20/2024, which, amongst other things, prevents owners for evicting tenants and curtails increases on rents for free market apartments.  read these laws to see the full scope of protections it provides for rental tenants. economist here. i made some replies in the comment. nyc is not the free market. there are price controls every where, ridiculous zoning laws that have contributed to housing shortages. see rand's study here : [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research\_reports/rra2775-1.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rra2775-1.html)  the fact that there are price controls essentially means everyone who is not under price controls generally pays more, because your subsidizing those below market rate units. especially since in new york unless its a new construction building with some sort of tax break, your highly likely in an old apartment that has a mix of rent stabilized units and units that were destabilized when the laws were more lax and that results that the people who are destabilized have to pay even higher prices. this is especially the case because if the apartment was rent stabilized a long time ago,  the price is so low that often the cost of maintaining the unit is more than what the paying (for example there are some rent stabilized tenants in my building paying 600$ a month).       rent stabilization  that is not via tax abatement is essentially extremely tenant friendly. it basically makes it near impossible to kick you out, your lease has to be renewed as long as your paying rent and not doing anything illegal. you can pass down the apartment lease along oyur family line. think aobut that from an owner's p.o.v.  the guy that your renting to basically has the right to the unit forever as long as they pay rent and don't break the law. you can't raise prices faster than inflation even if the market price in your area significantly higher or if the cost of maintenance goes up much faster than inflation etc. its basically like you don't even really own the place. so that is tenant friendly.  while the policies are good for people who are in stabilized housing they generally contribute to housing shortages and deter construction of new housing. they also push up the costs of non-stabilied rents. see survey on economic literature here : [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1051137724000020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1051137724000020)  the construction of multi-family housing requires milions of dollars and consequently, you have to actually attract investors. those investors are going to invest into other assets which leads to chronic under supply of housing. it’s a term property managers, landlords, and developers use because the law is a smidge to the left of “we want to charge you as much as we want and kick you out when we want”. they can do almost the former as it is in most circumstances and it’s still not enough for them. just the name ""land lord"" gives me chills it’s squatter friendly. it's ridiculous. the court benefits tenants have pale in comparison to the power of landlords in this city have over a necessary part of everyone's survival.  the amount of landlords facing 0 consequences for years for having slum buildings is ridiculous. there's a building down the block from me that hasn't had gas for years. all so the landlord who is out of the country can make the tenants leave their homes.  not to mention that the reason landlords complain so much about the courts is because they can't be bothered to bring an actual case when handling evictions. they want to evict with no oversight because it's their property, people living there for survival be damned. so what? go and recreate the 'new york experience' in some other place. if you could hook a decent paying gig in some secondary city - lets say baltimore, you could get yourself a really great space for only a fraction of the nyc cost. with the extra money, you could fit it out any way you want. they have bars and restaurants there. they have pretty boys and pretty girls too. in fact you might find it way easier to hook up with the type of person that you want. and you can still dress up in all of the latest fashions. bonus points are that you can probably have a car, and they also have an airport where you can fly to anyplace you want.  you're killing yourself just to barely latch on to the bare minimum existence in a place like nyc. you gotta come in through the back door. (but first you’ll have to find it.) we have more protections and rights for tenants than many states. the states with fewer protections generally have more functional housing markets and much lower housing costs relative to income.  here in nyc people can’t afford to move when their housing situation is subpar and they can try to sue for improvements, or get the city involved to otherwise force resolution, instead.  elsewhere people have more affordable housing options and can simply leave shitty landlords in favor of other options.  so in summary our housing market is hostile to tenants, while our courts are more favorable to tenants. i'm a mom and pop landlord for 20 years in manhattan. i suppose the most friendly element is that 311 exists and if you're out of heat or hot water or have mold or rats or bedbugs etc the landlord is on notice with building violations. that may not be the recourse you want, but it does help with finding out which landlords have multiple violations aka which landlords to avoid.     responses from your original post - i've never engaged a broker and always list as no fee, i don't offer renewal leases on horrible tenants (gasp they exist) but thankfully in 20 years this has been rare, on the vast majority of renewals the hike is low single digits in % terms. tenant/landlord relationship should be the same as any service business. i think you're out of the loop. housing court process takes 6-8 months minimum to receive warrant for evictions. you have free legal representation in housing court. good cause eviction was just implemented - allows allows for 5%+cpi for rent increases, even on fair market units. the list goes on and on. obviously a long list of pros and cons, but some of the reason rents are so high and applications so restrictive is because of how hard it is to evict a non-paying or bad tenant. just stupid laws and regulations put in place by uneducated people that fuck over everyone else as usual  there’s also a lot of other requirements around notice of things, a lot of the paperwork you sign/ignore when you sign a lease (window guards, bed bugs, smoke alarms, etc). you’ve never been to landlord tenant court have you lol i have a question - why not try the no fee rental buildings? is that bc they're usually luxury highrises? not sure what you're looking for, but wife and i just found a rent stabilized apt in a full service building, and it was quite easy. application process took ten minutes. and we saw a bunch of other great apartments, many also rent stabilized, just weren't a great fit for us.   none of the applications seemed very rigorous beyond good credit and salary of 40x monthly rent.  found them all in streeteasy.  looked in downtown bk to crown heights, and a few in gowanus. ny in general and nyc in particular are considered tenant friendly bc it's extremely hard to evict a tenant for any reason. in many states, if a tenant does not pay rent, the eviction process takes weeks or maybe a month. in nyc, a person can move in and never pay another month's rent and it will take you 20 months to get that person out. you can hopefully understand how it's really hard for an ordinary working person to pay subsidize someone else's living expenses for 20 months.   what most people don't know is that housing court cases are not overseen by actual judges but by attorneys appointed by some committee. the committee almost always appoints former tenants rights attorneys. so, even if your tenant is much wealthier than you or completely in the wrong, there is a presumption that the ll is the rich bad guy and the tenant is an poor angel.  i rented in nyc for decades. so i know it can sometimes feel like you need a ""prostate exam"" to get an apartment. what i didn't figure out until much later is that a large part of the reason it feels that way is bc nyc is so tenant friendly. put succinctly, if you know that whoever you rent to can live rent free in your apartment for 20 months, you're going to be very careful who you rent to.  so, in some ways the laws meant to help tenants actually hurt them. and in my experience i would say that most attempts by local politicians to further skew things in tenants favor actually end up making things worse for at least some segment of the renter pool.   i should point out that you are never forced to pay a broker's fee. in decades of renting i never paid one (though i also never lived in fancy places). and i always rent out my apts myself, without the help of a broker. i think lots of other small lls do the same.   op seems a bit confused about rent stabilization laws. and i could explain why rents in nyc are crazy, but i'll save that for another post. this is already very long.   fyi i grew up below the poverty line. i meet plenty of lls who grew up w generational wealth, sure. but i also know plenty of lls who are regular blue collar working people who simply busted their ass and poured all their money into properties in areas that a lot of middle class white people had no interest in living in. real estate is one of the few ways us black folks can build meaningful wealth on america, and though i'm trying to be primarily informative here, i think a lot of us resent when white middle class and better people try to cut off that avenue for us. because other states are worse. look into arkansas renter laws; the house doesn't even have to be habitable. it’s tenant friendly because landlords have no rights as compared to tenants.  what this city allows some of its tenants to get away with is insane outside of nyc, even in long island, that doesn’t happen.  the laws were created to help with slum lords and horrific living situations, but have been parlayed into a game of “how long can i get away with this” by tenants and squatters.  but, landlords have very little recourse, ie “tenant friendly”.  and before you downvote me, yes i’m partial.  we had a family acquaintance recently murdered in her apartment by squatters.  even if she had discovered them squatting in her home, there was practically nothing she could have done to get rid of them. it’s not. that is the message that liberals have reinforced, where those who are in rent control/stabilized units are basically being subsidized by everyone else. by being delusional or outright lying. i don’t remember where i read it … probably some article about leases.  the lawyer in effect said that even though ny is landlords-friendly, the landlord still needs to fulfill xyz on the lease. the ""fair"" rent is what the market is willing to bear. that changes as the market changes. if you are renting and cannot afford the new rent, you need to move. if you want a stable price - that's what a fixed rate mortgage is for. it’s not tenant friendly.  it’s just eviction friendly.",95,127,negative,0.6495500206947327,222,"you can ruin the landlords day (or rather, year+). if you don't care about the consequences, you can seriously ruin the landlords day (or rather, year+). if you don't care about the consequences, you can seriously ruin the landlords day (or rather, year+). if you don't know the law, you can take the tenant to court then circle back. if you want to get out, you need to"
177,Can someone explain what this scam is? Luxury studio apartment in Williamsburg $1.9K on StreetEasy…,"mystery solved, it's a typo, guys [deleted] on the market for 65 days? it's likely going to be scummy but not scammy lead gen for the broker -- you inquire about this, they say its no longer available but they have other units to show you.  if they actually try to sell you the unit, then it's just probably standard scam stuff of getting a deposit before seeing the unit or w/e. udr is a very reputable landlord so i don’t think it’s a scam by any means, not sure what’s going on with the price changing by ~1500, leads me to think it may be rent stabilized because of the very odd rent price. just reach out and ask. we messaged something similar while apartment hunting and they wanted a good-will deposit via bitcoin. since it’s the leasing office, this actual unit and price are likely not available.  when you arrive, you will be shown similar units, with the normal rent.  sometimes the listed unit you see is the leasing office’s office.  so no occupant, ever.  and can be used as a sort of scummy way to bring potential tenants in. very likely a sneaky net rent price, so you'll coast on free month(s) then get slammed with the full rent. no i messaged them about the same apartment and the leasing office told me it was a glitch in the system. the real unit is $3400 i am guessing this is a typo. i don't think they're offering so much free rent that the net effective price is that price. udr is legit and can be trusted, so i am guessing if you reach out and speak to a human (they use bots and talking to a person can be difficult to do), that they will reply this is not the actual price it’s likely income restricted lottery apartment - they have to keep the price low and only people who make specific income can get it studio: https://www.udr.com/new-york-city-apartments/williamsburg/leonard-pointe/apartments-pricing/#/?beds=0  no available apartments.   best thing to do is track down the management's info and ask about the listing to verify if it's a scam or not. udr is legit. i’d look up the building and contact the leasing office directly. is it month to month or less than a year could be an off-season discount and would expire around june or july if not, could just be one in revenue now when the economy and market heads up, they’ll start pressuring you to move out also, if they can find someway to not have account against their mortgage, they were almost always give you a pretty hefty discount rather than have the unit sit vacant often times after the claim you’re doing some sort of creative work order somehow and amenity to the other buildings residence or i don’t know you’re a caretaker resident or some sort of legal fiction. basically say that’s why we can charge you less rent or they have enough units we’re not paid off of it one factor mortgage rates the mortgage rate issue creates a bunch of weird logic for apartments, including having a high sticker price for the rocks below price for like four months, free. while keeping a higher sticker price. it’s even crazier in commercial. that’s why you can have an office building behalf, empty and have a lot of people interested in store, fronts or office spaces and they won’t be rented because it’s cheaper in the landlords for you to keep 50% vacant then get their mortgage rates who raised by going up to 80% occupied with a lot of smaller or lower paying tenets you contact them and they’ll know your price range and show you similar priced rentals 🤔  or i lived in that building for 2 years in 2019/2020 i got in at a lower than market rate rent due to the l train ""closing"". the following year when it was time to renew saw a huge increase, they weren't flexible. be careful with the net effective rent advertisement if you want to stay for longer than a year. i mean just contact them and see what’s up it’s just a broker trying to get your attention. i’ve seen them do this over the years. use a fake price to get your cell number, then they tell you the place just rented and that they can show you similar inventory in that price range which are mostly dumps they are desperate to rent. it might be a net apartment listing. they may be offering free months of rent, and the price you’re seeing is the rent with the free months taken into account. you’d still need 40x rent, sometimes down to 30x, to qualify. not including free rent. :: gestures :: maybe someone died there? lol maybe there’s an application fee and it gets people to apply and taking their money without ever considering renting the apt. not sure for this one but i know a lot of people do this and will get hundred of applications a month off of it /scams it’s probably an affordable apartment with income restrictions maybe the cost of rent is going down in nyc furthermore i was responding to the ""fraud comment""  whether it's streeteasy, or the rls, it's still not illegal to advertise the net thats a scam. run away it could also be for income limit housing thing too wild that people are paying $4k for a 400 square foot studio. thats like the size of my living room in queens! could he a housing lottery unit",99,53,negative,0.487882524728775,152,"to get your number and get your phone number. they use a fake price to get your number and get your cell number, then they tell you the place just rented and that they have similar inventory in the area. they get your number, then they call you and ask for your phone number. they get your number, then they call you back and tell you the place is no longer available. they ask for a deposit and then you leave. it's probably just"
178,How not to lose my nerve when roommates are pressuring me to leave?,"as you said, they can't make you leave. their choices are to leave or stay, which are also the same choices you have.  i'd try your best to remember this is only temporary and continue to apply to other things. when you find something better, give them 30 days notice, and leave thats really tough - but i think you gotta just focus all of your energy on moving to a new place. its not healthy to live somewhere that you dont feel comfortable. dont worry about being 'chill' or cool with them. keep it emotionless and focus on moving out. just respond that you don't want to be in the apartment as much as they don't want you in the apartment. give them an update on your search, but state you aren't going into financial ruin because of somebody else's ""vibes.""   tell them for a certain amount you'll be out by tomorrow, anything short of that everybody needs to take a bite of that shit sandwich. hey — sorry you are going through this. shitty situation to be in and i’m sure they don’t care about what it’s like to be on the other side of this. i don’t have any advice other than what has already been posted, just wanted to say i’m sorry you’re going through this, it sounds really uncomfortable roommates suck, sorry you are going through this. i wonder if they are doing this because they have someone in mind they want to take your place. it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong so this is 100% a 'them' issue, but it sounds like they don't have the maturity to have an honest conversation with you. get a very strong lock for your door!!! what snotty little brats. youre gonna get out of there soon- a lot opens up in may and i bet you can find something suitable by the end of the month. sometimes it’s easier to find another person looking that you can find a 2 bed with. if i were in your position i would try to basically business transaction these people. treat them like your landlord because you have a lot of rights as a tenant. drop any kind of hope or expectation of friendliness, it's not cool what they're doing to you. it's your life and livelihood, fuck their vibes tell them to leave wtf i’m sorry you’re going through this. if you’re able to set up a little camera in your room, that would be a good call. also, be sure your bedroom door is locked. (buy a new lock asap if you have to.) they’re being very crappy and insensitive and probably want a friend of theirs to move in so they’re bullying you out.   take your time and be sure you find something that works for *you*. ignore them unless it’s to give an update and stay away from them as much as possible. you didn’t do anything wrong. don’t back down. best of luck! i hope you can get into the building with a family member. are you on a sublease? first off - sorry your roommates are assholes.  second - sounds like you have negotiating power. if they want you gone desperately why not ask them to find and pay 20% of the rent at your next spot?   give them your neighborhoods and wants and let them do the work for you and deliver you a discount.   i’d happily request they put their money where their mouth is. i’m sorry you are going through this. is there any way you can mute or even block their messages and ask for another form of communication like email which you can reroute to a folder so that you can look at their communications when *you* want to? at this point, it’s not like asking can make the situation much worse? find some courage to tell them to fuck off. yea it’s not peaceful to have roommates like that but they can’t make you leave. you will leave when you are good and ready and found a better place that you can afford . tell your roommates the next time either of them talk to you about leaving you will immediately stop paying rent to them and your uncle who is a lawyer will hold the your rent money in escrow while you go through the housing court process. let them know you are fully aware of your rights as a tenant and intend to defend them. you got bo? yea, i mean, like others have said, legally, you don't have to do anything, the cards are all in your hands. they've already burned the bridge, so the way you keep your cool is basically realize, these people are the equivalent to strangers that you might cross path with on the street, remain cordial, but enforce your boundaries exactly as if some person from the street decided to be a dick and say something rude or give you a nasty look, a nice quick ""fuck you too buddy"" should wake them the fuck up tell them to get over it, be mature and act like adults. whose name is on the lease? how much longer is your contract going for? ultimately look for something better and in the mean time tell them to kick rocks. are you getting a deposit back? tell them you are working on the low income housing deal, and also still looking, but it will take the time it takes cause you are not a millionaire and can't just jump out to another place so fast. then stay out of each other's hair till something comes up, but keep looking. affordable housing place will work out eventually, even if you move someplace else in the meantime while you wait. best of luck op and keep your head up.  it seems like you are doing your best to look for a new place.  try the gypsy housing facebook group and fb marketplace.  found most of my apartments in the city that way i am so sorry you are going through this and the only thing i can say is keep looking, put your all into it, and remember this too shall pass. this is not forever, this is not even for a long time. this is temporary and it will soon be history. move",95,53,negative,0.7324219942092896,148,"and landlord can make you leave. legally, you don't have to do anything. i mean, legally, you can't make them leave. legally, you can't do anything. legally, you can't. legally, you can. legally, you can. legally, you can. legally, you can. legally, legally, legally. legally, legally, legally."

180,This feels illegal,"is the living area min. 150sf? landlords/management companies are really getting crafty these days lol that shower is insane. my college had better showers and those were awful [deleted] did you scroll down the page?  [this sh*t box](https://streeteasy.com/building/333-neptune-avenue-brooklyn/d4) makes what you posted look like a palace. you’re not going to find a stabilization rider on an illegal apartment eh not for me but it could work if you are young and out all the time and just need a place to crash. right next to the subway, there's window and no roommate? damn good deal. as a surfer, it's perfect being so close to the beach. it’s probably got a huge fee.  but very cheap even with a big fee if you stay a couple years or more i’ll take it ! the only thing that should be illegal are shower kitchens. everything else is up for grabs jesus my dorm bathroom was bigger one way to make it more livable would be to put in a loftbed.  then you'd have some living space underneath it. honestly lowkey better than my apartment, they have modern appliances and it’s half the price. i’ve seen places for more that don’t even have a private bath. this is a great deal. i don't see any place to fit a bed in there. for all the people saying this isn’t that bad - where are they planning on putting a bed? in the shower? in front of the fridge/stove/sink? or in the +/- 2’x4’ space in the corner? most redditors would be too wide to get into the shower would rather take the pod the dude was renting out in another post lol people saying this is reasonable is insane. i lived in a 1 br over 1100 square feet, two closets including a walk in, floor to ceiling windows on the 19th floor with a view. building was shitty but the apartment was cool, in jersey next to a train station 19 minutes from the city for $900. thinking this is a deal is exactly why the housing market is what it is seemly square long friendly detail pet agonizing bike toothbrush dolls   *this post was mass deleted and anonymized with [redact](https://redact.dev)* people in the comments saying this is okay, no, no, it’s not. things like this shouldn’t exist. especially for that price and for that location. this is literally a storage room with a bathroom. where does the heat come from?  i see something outside the bathroom but it looks more like a small vent.  also no protection on that window so that will cost you unless you want someone to break it and walk right in, which is likely. there's worse for a lot more, unfortunately.

181,Is there no Yelp-like website for Apartments? Why???,"openigloo there’s an app called openigloo where you can read reviews of buildings from past and present residents and any violations that may have occurred. openigloo is the move.   *hopefully someone can help me find this*, but there *is* a government website that hosts all the complaints that building/management has received (i think the last 7 years at least?) and if it's had any bedbug complaints or the like.  there might be two, one for bedbug type things and one for just complaints. it's hard to find useful websites with all the spam nowadays, so if someone knows the link please share it why would i increase demand to live in a building i live in by leaving a good review? am i trying to raise my own rent? open igloo keep us posted if you're actually going to build it, i was thinking about building something similar a while back!   though i'm more of a pm / data scientist than a software engineer :/ happy to build this with u housing authority website shows complaints for any apartment done in the last 2 years   [hpd online](https://hpdonline.nyc.gov/hpdonline/building/324556/overview) most of the bigger buildings have plenty of reviews on google maps openigloo (reviews), whoownswhat.nyc (aggregates city data) google reviews seems insightful, what specific info do you need regarding apts ?  ok i guess google though doesn’t allow you to be anonymous cause you still going to rent it irregardless some of them are reviewed on google maps. what i've been doing is using these two websites to get a feel for how bad a building is.   https://portal.311.nyc.gov/check-status/  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/widgets/wz6d-d3jb that would be your labor of love because the owners or managers of the dumps want to keep their dirty secrets hidden and folks in good places want to keep it quiet. have you thought of doing it the old fashioned way and figuring out where you want to live, going by at various time of the day to check out the building and surrounding area and then just asking folks if they like where they live and if they had to say what are the 3-5 worst things are, would they share. i see so many people and businesses on yelp try to skewer the truth by posting their own hype reviews or yelp takes down reviews. also the city is useless in this area as well. there is [apartmentratings.com](https://apartmentratings.com)  the reviews seem real but i think the apartment managers post additional fake review to drown them out, so you have to look through a lot of reviews to really see what is going on because majority of apartments are small buildings anyway. the only places that would benefit from this are luxury units. its only a small number of people who review apartments or food etc. its perfectly plausible that a 12  to 25 unit complex  (most walkups) won't have a single tenant that bothers to complain about their specific address on the internet. it’s called the hpd database",96,29,neutral,0.5291963815689087,125,.. it’s a government website that hosts all the complaints that building/management has received in the last 2 years. it’s called the. it’s called the. it’s called the hpd online. it’s called the hpd database. it’s called the hpd online. there’s an app called openigloo is openigloo there’s there
182,Son ripped off by locksmith,"many times, those stickers are not recommended locksmith by the management.  these guys get in the building and place stickers on every door, knowing they'll get business...  any recommended tradesman or businesses likely would have been included in the welcome packet definitely picking up street smarts one way or another here nothing you can do but deal with the consequences. should always call the management or super for help first. the phone number is a lead generation service, they have multiple ""locksmiths"" whom they then text/call and first one wins. the locksmith needs to split 50-50  with the lead generator. they are encouraged to gouge on pricing. many of them are students or otherwise here without permission to work.   even if you look up local locksmiths online the results will often be fake (use street view to see if the store front actually exists) as the lead generators try to make believe they are local.   a local locksmith in nyc would charge 150-200 but may or may not be able to arrive quickly.   once you know your prices, you can negotiate even with the sharks. remember, some money is better than no money. last time that happened i simply told the guy that i already called the local guy who will be here in an hour for 150 and i'm not paying more that an extra 25 for the saved time. i have my laptop, wifi, etc. he saw i was serious and agreed to my price charged him $1700. or charged and promptly took payment of $1700. i recommend he make a few copies of his keys and leave them over a couple friends/families' apartments nearby. that's what i did. omg i’m so sorry to read this.  these locksmiths (especially here in new york) are straight up con artists and they unapologetically take advantage of people knowing how vulnerable they are in these instances.  this (pricing)  is something that should be regulated by the government somehow because folk are gonna get locked out and sometimes the super is not anywhere to be found.  i put my own lockbox outside of my building because i was taken advantage of as well. a nyc newbie rite of passage. happened to me my second week here. i’ve had a lock box outside ever since. now your son has learned a lesson and some street smarts. did he sign an estimate or sign off for the work being done? call them and sternly say you’re aware that they charged a gigantically inflated fee. quote them a fair market price and negotiate.  this worked for someone i know once. they might still land on a rip-off rate but it won’t be $1700. they know they’re scamming, so if they can make a small profit off the transaction, they’re still ahead.  and yeah, then tell your son this is a very common scam in the city and to never let this happen to him again. lock smiths can be a shady group.  expensive lesson to be learned… locksmith are not recommended by the building. that price is also overkill he definitely took advantage. did your son ask for a cost estimate before making the appointment for the locksmith to physically come? pay the locksmith. don't tell management. leave a copy of the new key at a friend's or workplace. learn a lesson. when those guys place those stickers on my building, i immediately rip them off. they’re crooks. son made a huge mistake. he won’t do it again. going fwd he needs to call the super—that’s it future reference, call the landlord.  they likely have extra keys or will take care of the issue for far less.  if the landlord or management isn’t reachable, that is a red flag to begin with.  in the meantime, tell your kid to do what i did in college and as a young man, wear their keys on a belt loop on a carabiner so they’ll never leave without them. negative reviews and perhaps filing a complaint with the bbb is probably your only recourse. :( same thing happened to my boyfriend. new york transplant rite of passage unfortunately new to nyc in my early 20s i made this same mistake, this was over a decade ago and ended up paying $700 - it was also around 3am so i wasn’t going to fight it   next time i got locked out, i went to home depot bought tools and destroyed the lock myself did he try to contact the super or landlord at all before calling the locksmith? he should have called a few locksmiths first and  ask for the cost upfront before the job was completed.  he doesn't sound very smart or savvy 3 bedrooms - so no roommates to call?? does he have a super? that’s who i asked when i was locked out you could call and threaten to file a charge back and renegotiate for some of your money back. however, the funds went through zelle and the “locksmith” may know that you cannot file a charge back through zelle.    there isn’t really much you can do except some posturing/ intimidation on the locksmith and encourage your son to exercise some better decision making next time. expensive lesson to learn but such is life.   source: parents intervened in a similar situation involving a mechanic.   tip if you submit a demand in writing on an official letter head that tends to scare people into favorable action. the not changing the locks thing is usually because they need access to a copy of your key or need to have a master programmed for maintenance.  explain the situation, offer to have a copy made or a master programmed, there's no ill intent and with the right next steps there would be no harm done, the best you can hope for is that they appreciate the honesty and the solution to the core problem behind the rule and move on.  worst case scenario your son, through the locksmith that he hired and paid for, broke the terms of his lease, and could be evicted. to be clear, you cannot effectively hide the change, they will find the change, maybe during his occupancy, maybe after, but if things do not get cleared up and resolved your worst case scenario is eviction, mild case id loosing the security deposit, best case is an amicable resolution between all parties.  i'm not a lawyer, none of this is legal advice, i'm just a normal person thinking out a shitty situation presented to me you need to have a talk with your kid, this happens all the time but only if you let it this stuff really only happens to people who are afraid to speak up, time for him to learn that it’s a very typical nyc scam in the future, he can scan his key at a keyme kiosk and it will save it. if he ever loses his key, he can go to any kiosk and it will cut him a new key. if the payment is already made are you going to sue him to get it back? if not let it go. i always ask upfront what the charge is before having them come out. depends what kind of lock he got it couple been worth $750-$1000 but $1700 was definitely too much i would first politely ask for a refund. after being turned down, check their license status. get ready to file a complaint with consumer affairs (consumer and worker protection)  https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/consumers/file-complaint.page  they will help! i had to change the locks on 3 doors after an event. i didn't realize there is a difference between rekeying and replacing. i unwittingly replaced all the locks and it was far more expensive than the rekeying i really needed. don’t pay. the locksmith has to then make a claim, but no judge is going to allow a claim for $1700 for a locksmith unless that was made clear, in writing, before the work was done. an emergency lock replacement is more in the region of $300. unless his roommates dead-bolted the door after he left, he should have been able to credit card the door open. i've done this countless times, in every apartment i've lived in in nyc. even recently. most often it's when i'm doing laundry and stepping in and out of the place.  but i've also been ripped off by the locksmith. but not for 1700! your son got got. never never call the number on the door anyone can post it. unfortunately he needed to google & do his due diligence. he completely got taken advantage of. please post the locksmith & this shady practice company interesting he didnt call the super first as soon as he was locked out. typically the only person in the building who has back up keys for every apartment. it’s a scam usually run by israelis . $100 fee becomes $2000. also don’t trust google reviews , yelp is more reliable . every dip shit had 5 stars on google lol what college kid has $1700 and is willing to hand that over no fuss? im sorry, that guy was a jerk but your son is not bright. 1/3 to 1/2 of that would be a fair price. tell him to make his own reddit post to find out. you aren’t helping him by doing all of this for him. i would start by calling them and trying to negotiate with a price close to the local rate. people forget that to do a transaction you need a contract. and to agree to a contract both parties must be informed of the terms and conditions. if you son called them and they didn’t give an estimate and didn’t agree to the work they did, then they don’t have a contract to uphold. i would contact them and inform them they did unwanted work that goes against the lease. say your son could have checked but as a business they should have checked. say you don’t expect them to put the old lock back but you can agree on a lower rate. you could also say you’ll report them to the better business bureau and leave a negative review if they try and uphold their non-existent contract. this will be 3x harder to do if you already paid them tho. gl to you! at first i felt like this was a bad and expensive lesson to learn, but if your son can afford to live in a 3br in the east village, then he's paying significantly less than a month's rent for this, which is not the end of the world.    a 3 bed yet no other roommates to open the door / have copies of they key.... lol small claims court. i had to change a lock once but it was a multilock and it was about that much and the landlord paid my back probably could have gotten in using a credit card. seriously, even the mortise locks that 90% of apartment buildings use can be opened easily. if you already paid then only thing left is dispute and complain on socials.  if you haven't paid yet it's a different story some doors that self lock can be opened on the side with a card chargeback just out of curiosity, how much should this service cost? this happened to a friend before. sucks but you pay it and move on. tough lesson to learn. 1700 dollars is absolutely predatory.   300-400 would be normal. (it is a painfully expensive situation and drilling into the lock and replacing it is typical if opening it with a piece of plastic does not work.)  locksmiths are regulated.   perhaps start here and file a complaint for price gouging?  [https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/index.page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/index.page)  hope that helps,   suzanne locksmiths in nyc will gouge your eyeballs out without drawing any blood.   only met one that was straight up with me located on the ues - abc. this scam is as old as the city itself lmao. a real locksmith would never just change the locks like that, and, (a real locksmith) would have had the door open in 2 minutes max with 0 drilling for a price of $75-$200, (depending on who you call, day of the week, and time of day) the second this ""locksmith"" started drilling your son should have yelled at him to stop what he was doing. prior to calling a locksmith your son should have called his roommates first, then the super and/or the landlord if his roommates weren't around.   if i were you i'd tell your son to make a few copies of the key and leave one hidden somewhere outside the apartment, and the other couple with friends in the neighborhood and maybe a trusted neighborhood business if he's a regular at any, i have a spare at the bar down the block from me. that $1700 is gone and hopefully your kid's landlord is not a huge dickhead because there's a chance he could get raked over the coals because i'm pretty sure changing the locks is a pretty big lease violation. it was a learning experience for your kid tell him to wise up and actually think through the decisions that he makes. this explains it. replyall (nycpodcast now off the air, very quickly to the drill). explains all about the well known locksmith scam in nyc.  https://open.spotify.com/episode/5rbfz85fiseutt4hh3bpwy?si=tdecytcmr_wfjcyk_tcm3a it probably won't work, but send them an official ish sounding letter/email telling them they need to refund you xyz amount in the same form it was paid to them. inform them if not you will be filing a complaint with the ny attorney general for price gouging.   https://formsnym.ag.ny.gov/oagonlinesubmissionform/faces/oagpgchome;jsessionid=17fdumaxamxlxw_lf0cn-v5is_8urmtsyyfw99kefk8obpatv2wc!274342344  idk why everyone is being so mean about this. we all get played at least once living here, and that's how you learn. do a chargeback, fuck that this happened to me a few years ago. i locked myself out of my apartment and called the first company i found online. i was quoted $100 price on the phone, but once the guy completed the work, he said $500. i panicked and just paid him. he basically made a hole on the lock, and that was it, not even replacing the lock. after he left i felt he overcharged me. i did some research and learned that this is basically a scam these people do, targeting seniors or people that dont know what is a fair price. i decided to call the company and told them the situation but they didn't want to do anything about it, so i threatened to submit a complaint to the department of consumer affairs-- suddenly they decided that they were going to give me back $200. i accepted as, at least, it was something.     my suggestion is to ask your son to call the company and ask for some money back or otherwise submit a complaint to the department of consumer affairs. most credit card companies allow a charge back. i would state it as fraud, because that is what it is. he deceived your son and overcharged. i'd be pissed. locks are being automated. apartment communities are actually locking people out for not giving up their biometrics. yes, this is actually a thing. yes, it can be illegal, yes, this topic is being ignored by local government. hi. please dm me i’m a locksmith in the city i want more information on this. write reviews everywhere, maybe they will exchange some payment for removal after some time. also, tell the kid not to beat himself up as the past is unchanging. i’d  go over the proper way to handle this in case an emergency occurs in the future., it’s always best to do your own due diligence these days, go over actions to make sure locking keys inside will not happen again, not submitting to absurd payment especially when the provider did not clarify absurd price prior to beginning, calming down before making rash decisions like calling the first service number you see, & lastly always avoid paying service providers through zelle. best payment for business transaction is paypal (business not family and friends category)… if business is chosen and you purchase a thing or service that’s scammy you can get a refund via paypal eek. not much help but for future - ask em to try  to pick the lock first.  i think it costed me like 150 which felt steep for a 5 min job but i was fresh out the er and wanted to sleep dude was never a locksmith just a dude huh... didn't know you couldn't change out locks.   i always changed mine for security. https://preview.redd.it/07q33x5k9rrd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5184030a2775578826f3726d7e1a915cc2ad466  was this the sticker? why didn’t he call the super? and by the way, a 3 br in the east village??? he can afford the $1700. let your son deal with this on his own. having mommy try to help him is almost worse than being taken advantage of by a ny locksmith. teach him to pick a lock. i’d dispute the fuck out of that with the bank & explain the situation because what the literal fuck. this is fucked up id be out for blood. three dudes sharing one bathroom?

183,"Signing a lease for a 1BR in Astoria for $1,860. Is this good?","yeah, it's good.  living alone for 1860 anywhere in the 5 boroughs is good, under any conditions.  if it's being renovated you're beating the general market, i'd say.  i'm no expert but i've been looking for something like that and it's not to be found even in the bronx. very good deal excellent deal you struck gold. this almost feels like a flex 🧐 it’s a decent, but not unheard of, deal. it’d probably be at least a few hundred more if it was a 5 vs. 10 minute walk, so essentially you’re saving thousands a year by walking 5 extra minutes. great deal but want to make sure you have physically seen this place in person rent stabilized too? phenomenal. what appliances does it have?  how much window space / natural light is there?  closets?  how big is the bedroom and living room?  and most importantly, how much are you paying in broker fees?   1860 would generally be a good deal for a 1br, even without laundry, but i’d be curious to hear more specific details about the apartment to know just how good of a deal this is.  if you’re paying a high broker fee and end up moving out after only 12 months, that may not end up being as good of a deal as you initially thought. love astoria 😍 good deal great price for the neighborhood amazing deal. take it and don’t look back. yeah you did good you can't get a better deal than that. how’d you figure it was a rent stabilized apartment? i was paying $1675 and i let my apartment go. biggest regret 😢 somebody on this forum just signed a studio for $1400 so yeah it’s a great deal - next to perfect this is a fantastic deal. $1860 rent stabilized and renovated ? i’d say you hit the jackpot ! if you’ve looked around at all, i’m sure you already know it’s good deal… the 40’s is one of the nicer parts of ditmars. you got a deal. [removed] no - it’s not a good deal 🙄 absolutely!!!!  how did you find this??? i used to live 21st ave and 31st street...astoria is a lil pricy but it's made up for with everything around u. the market everywhere is crap in nyc so if u don't wanna own a condo elsewhere then astoria is your best bet good deal. check the bug registry tho if that’s still a thing. pretty amazing deal these days as long as it’s not in the acropolis you are doing well! astoria is becoming a popular place for more moderate rent. it has character, food, and great proximity. you did well.   best of luck,  suzanne wow great deal 21st ave. & 35th st.? make sure it’s not in a janky area [deleted] probably is fake",94,67,positive,0.6324242353439331,161,i’d say you did well.... i’d say it’s good. living alone for 1860 anywhere in the 5 boroughs is good. i've looked around and it's not hard to find. great deal. great price for the neighborhood. great deal. great deal. great deal. great deal. great deal.
184,St Marks Place,"take it you are not going to sleep in the hallways. take it! is this a six-story walkup? still sounds like a good deal. unless you will have neighbors that are a hazard to your life, or can't manage the stairs, it sounds amazing. and be attentive to what you need as far a shopping so you don’t have to go up and down a bunch. you’ll be in great shape- i lived on the 5 th floor for many years. it’s not bad at all and the views are great! six flights would make me a homebody, but the hallway wouldn't bother me. great location, great price! do you know the management company name? there is somebody who has been posting all over social media about a really terrible landlord who owns a bunch of properties on st mark's that fit that description. i wonder if you're getting a deal because it's a complete hole...  i'll try and search for the post now... citi urban management bro $1600 is a screaming deal.   i’m paying like $2400 for a studio three blocks away from you. absolutely take it. $1600 for no roommates, cmon   if you take it, then you’re underpaying rent by at least $400 a month. also the hallways are always ugly; it’s actually a meme on tiktok right now. i live on the fifth floor and it’s fine. it takes like 45 seconds to go up, it’s not a bad thing if you’re under like 45yo lol.   if you don’t take it, let me have it. my lease is up in august and i’d love to save $800 a month for another studio. this is a dream deal in an excellent location.  i was paying 2300 (rent stabilized) 5 th floor walk up on 2nd and 9th 13 years ago. run to this person and take! i don't believe any landlords are doing ""favors"" for no reason. if it's a decent studio in an old building for $1,600 it's probably rent stabilized, which means yes you should absolutely jump on it. i had a studio on st marks between 1st and 2nd in the 90s for $1400, it was basically a long hallway with a 18 x 12 room at the back. the pygmy bath tub and a great view of a brick wall were bonuses. do you live in the hallway? you want a nice building for $1600/month? don't look a gift horse in the mouth. take it bro niche april fools joke. i lived on st marks between 2nd and 3rd on top of a loud bar 10 years ago and it was $3200 (2 bedrooms, one closet sized kitchen one bathroom.)   this seems like you got an amazing deal it's $1600. count your lucky stars. i would check out the block / building at all different times of day. go early in the morning, afternoon, night….. see what happens. are there a lot of drug addicts that show up at night & make it unsafe to get in the building?  do homeless people hang out in the vestibule or lobby ?  that kind of thing . possibly see if you can engage other people that live in the building & ask them what the building is like. what they think. do all this asap. this is ny - apt no matter quality go real fast. if all goes well you should take it. $1600 for easy village is a steal no, that’s a steal and take it. my building hallways are bright red and gray which is a terrible color scheme but inside my apartment it’s so bright and light. complete opposite of the hallway. make sure that whatever they say are including their legit, including and not just using it as a ploy and hook that’s one thing and also keep in mind if long-term you’d be ok with the six flights of stairs, and at the same time, keeping hallways clean, isn’t hard management is definitely doing something shady. if they can’t upkeep it hiring a porter is not that expensive. jump on this now!  i lived in that area and it was awesome. i suppose there is more nightlife in other areas but you don't want to live in an area with a lot of drunks in bars and clubs.  my apartment was facing away from the street and frankly very quiet (you would need to check if that also is the case in your apartment). st marks further west gets noisy, dirty with more foot traffic at night but is closer to subways.  most of the hallways i saw in the east village were terrible. frankly most of the hallways in nyc.  $1600 might have been a good price even in the year 2000. that block isn’t loud anyway, it’s only crazy between 2nd and 3rd & sort of 1st & a i lived in st. marks, because of all the restaurants it was crawling with mice and rats. and if the building is not maintained cleanly, it means they are not checking for holes either. you will have a mice problem. [deleted] i highly highly recommend searching through the department of building's database, it will give you more reliable information than word of mouth.  https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bispi00.jsp  enter the building information and just check for any major red flags: unresolved, open complaints, how often they have pest problems, does the hot water run out often? etc....  things like peeling paint and creaky floors are superficial and easy enough to deal with. i live on 5th floor walk up and got used to it super quick. only problem is during disgusting nyc summer, need to take a breather when i get in and it always hits guests lol.   i live round there and would advise having any packages sent to office/drop off location/friends house wi the better security cos there’s so much package theft round there especially in the older buildings with little to no security and funky door set ups. people legit wait until someone goes in, grabs packages and bolt. our landlord said that all the cctv footage shows that it usually all happens in less than 20 seconds. check the nyc housing website to see how many complaints there are against the building. i got a “great” deal during covid and the apartment ended up being run by slumlords. leaks, intermittent hot water, squatters selling drugs and having sex in the hallways, people trying to break into my apartment while i was there.   the landlord was actually just arrested and has to serve time at rikers for being so terrible. long story short, if it’s truly a bad building that is detrimental to your health and safety, it doesn’t matter how cheap it is. so your research. 1600/month on saint marks is a steal. you can’t rent a dumpster for that. take it! are you planning on living in the hallway?  if not, then no it shouldn't bother you. take it and run!   if you want a nice hallway and entrance,  expect to pay $2500 in ev. tell you washstand for 200 a month i’ll clean the whole stairs for you, hallways and all including some light paint work i am a fan of housing preservation i would kinda kill for that on st marks in this economy do it dude   you will have fun in this area   save money   and experience the classic les pre war walk up tenement vibe !   look at the lack of maintenance like “art” or “character” look up how to check for signs of roach or mice infestation and if there isn’t any sign of infestation i would take it. also agree with showing up at diff times of day to scope it out. is it rent stabilized? my 6th floor apartments really nice but the hallways are disgusting. nieces and nephews of longtime tenants constntly smoking weed and cigarettes, sunflower seeds on the floor, paint chipping, dirty. but its a liminal space so i dont spend much time there take it. if you’re planning on living here for life take advantage of the low rent to save up for a place that is more accessible (elevator, ramps, newer building, etc.) but yes if i were you i would take it first time i had my home broken into was on a second floor apartment on st marks. insane place to live take it and if you decide later you don't want it someone else will take it i’ll take it :) dear lord, take it. the hallway will make you feel like a real new yowker and you can furnish your apartment however you like. two things. find out how many/what other properties the owner owns here https://whoownswhat.justfix.org/en/  and then check department of buildings for violations on the place you’re considering. dob isn’t guaranteed to have anything even if your place is a death trap, but if you turn up serious infractions, the cheap rent may not be worth the risk. $$1,600 for a large studio on st. marks?   either total bs or........april fools!!! if you won’t take it i will thanks too everyone for the advice. i’ve only recently moved too nyc so all of this was quite new to me a lot of the buildings around the area will not be in great shape. however at that price it is a steal. that’s absolutely a great deal. that’s an insanely good deal. i wouldn’t pay it much attention - my apartment and the majority of walk up apartments have done renovations so while the exterior/hallways look rough, the inside of your unit could be great. i’m the first resident in my unit after the gutted the entire thing for renovations i would in a heartbeat that sounds like an unreal deal “hi guys i’ve won the lottery but they’re making me sign the check in blue ink, but i prefer black ink. i’m thinking of passing on the money because of this. thoughts?”   -probably op take it or i will.",95,84,positive,0.6063205003738403,179,"i would say take it. it's a great location, great price! i lived in that area and it was awesome. i would say take it because it's a great location, great price and great views. i would say take it because it's a great location, great price and great views. i would also check out the building at different times of day. morning, afternoon, night. i would say take it because"
185,Package stolen from lobby of building I just moved into - both landlord and fedex say they can do nothing,"sorry this happened to you. if you were the sender, did you purchase insurance? iirc fedex insurance does cover theft, i’m sure there are hoops to jump through but it’s something that’s shitty, people are trash but unfortunately if there isn’t a concierge who checks in packages, it’s a lost cause on the buildings end. most likely a guest or delivery person who stole it. i know it’s inconvenient but always have your stuff shipped where you can pick it up. try filing a missing package claim with fedex anyway. always send fedex to the nearest duane reade for pick up. always send ups to the nearest access point store. unfortunately fedex did its job in delivering the package so you probably won’t get anywhere in terms of filing a claim with them.   it’s possible that a neighbor stole it or a neighbor unknowingly held the door and let a thief into the building who took it.   i would consider posting a note in the package area saying something like:   “hi neighbors,   on (date), a fedex package was delivered for apt xyz but unfortunately was taken by someone else.   if you accidentally took this box, please return it to xyz as soon as possible. it has great sentimental value to me.   working with management to get the security camera footage but hopefully someone is able to return it before then. thank you!” unfortunate reality of city living. neighbors can be scum. i’d suggest filing a police report(?) so there’s some official documentation to go through insurance. so sorry this happened to you. i had my packages delivered to a package center in my area. like this one called ""bounce"".  https://usebounce.com/packages/new-york?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=pmax&utm_campaign=%7bcampaignname%7d&hsa_grp=&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gclid=cjwkcajwkuqvbhaqeiwa65xxqkhpjfkq98pwiegrb-nl4q3i8nezyvjblb-lnyeh_2xh4ibumor8ixocvjsqavd_bwe this is going to be a thing.  walkups and buildings without any proper secured mail room are simply easy targets for theft.  most apartments will not have good security when it comes to packages.  in this case, have deliveries done to your workplace/office or have them delivered to you on your day off when you can retrieve them the moment they arrive.  anyone whose lived here for more than a few years has had this happen at least once.  sorry that your first experience is a costly one.  in just the past decade i’ve had numerous small to large thefts.  if it’s an amazon delivery, thankfully you can just report that it happened and get a refund or credit.  same with meals on uber eats and doordash.  you’ll probably have 1 in every 20 or so meals disappear like this before they ever reach you.  the drivers get hungry and snatch a customer meal.  and just take the slap on the wrist.  could be a stranger who accessed the lobby.  could be a slimy neighbor (or even your landlord).  even the delivery drivers themselves know how to game the system and will disappear an item or two every once in awhile.  and doormen, porters, or the numerous other delivery people who access your lobby throughout the day.  as others have said, see if you can check any lobby cams via your resident manager if footage exists.  other than that, find a new solution for delivery.  either while you’re home.  or to a central pickup point/delivery center.  or to your place of work. “package not delivered” request signature next time i’m surprised this is even a post. i have never lived in a building where your package being stolen wasn’t a likelihood and figured anyone without a doorman would be close to the same. amex, that’s all. they will give you your money back. would not be surprised at all if it was the fedex person who took it. thats what was happening in my building. get your money back from your bank. it’s common knowledge to pick up your packages as soon as it arrives. package theft is huge in new york. i’m sorry this happened it’s happened to me plenty of times :( if you can. call your bank on the card you used and tell them what happened. especially if it’s a credit card. never get an expensive package delivered to an unsecured area without tracking it closely and being home to pick it up as soon as it gets there.  do you have renters insurance? if not, get some - i believe it can cover theft. sorry, there’s people who literally follow delivery trucks and their entire job is to steal packages.  also, police don’t care because when i went vigilante and found the very distinctive van (with specific damage to the rear passenger light that was captured by my ring camera and a neighbors camera) parked a couple of towns over from me, police said “ok we will look into it” (and i know they won’t) even though these people were caught stealing from dozens of homes. unfortunately happens in my building as well- i try to have high value sent to my corp office or others who have doormen.   my neighbor did have the police come for stolen package, and the building posted of pics of guy who stole it. doesn’t seem fedex or building will get you anywhere unfortunately.   sorry this happened to you. i don’t have an advice, but i just wanna say, i’m so sorry you had this happened to you. i lost some valuables myself in the past, and can imagine what you’re going through right now. i hope by some miracle your stuff will come back to you! security system down, landlord claims 🤣   call the cops and have them check if that's true. hi, i just faced a similar situation with a box that had a value of over $200 and have been fighting with the brand and my management company about it.   the brand said: in cases where a package is stolen it becomes challenging for us to dispute it with the carrier to process a refund.   the property manager told me that the footage was gone and even if it wasn’t, it would cost way more than $200 for the security company to review that amount of footage.   i’m now filing a police report and disputing the charge with citibank including the texts from the property manager saying the footage is gone by now. just tell fedex that’s not even your building. check if the front door can be opened with a credit card. i realized thieves were just credit carding in my front door to steal packages. if so ask your landlord to fix it, but like others said get valuable packages delivered elsewhere sorry this happened to you. the only thing i can think of that hasn't already been mentioned is renter's insurance. might be worth taking a look at your policy and seeing if it's possible/worth filing a claim. i had a similar issue but with us mail. i had to file a police report and send it to the post master general. they did absolutely nothing. sorry this happened. call your bank. the one you used to make the purchase often the business that sent the package will send a new one if it never arrived or was stolen. try asking at the very least. see if your credit card offers purchase protection. american express has refunded me for stolen packages in the past after i filed a police report. if you paid your fedex shipping with your credit card i would contact your credit card while you use a better option in the future, have a fake exploding glitter ducks package left in the hallway for the thief. file a police report and file a claim with sender. so this happened to me but i’m pretty sure the package was delivered to the building next to mine. basically i’d been out of town - the package was delivered monday by usps. it was from poshmark and the delivery noted it was placed inside my mailbox. i wasn’t getting back home until friday but my neighbors who live across from me (we live on the 5th floor) always brings up my packages if they notice anything. i do the same for them.   so i get back friday and check my mailbox. nothing. then the following week i had an issue where my contacts were delivered via ups and they sent a picture and it wasn’t even my building. this same thing happened to be back in october where my amazon was delivered to the a building that wasn’t mine. idiots. i then thought about it and decided to check out the sister building next to my mine. my contacts were right there in the lobby.   conclusions: 1) i was able to get into that building no problem by just buzzing a bunch of random apts. i know annoying but comes to show that people just mindlessly press open.  2) it made me think that poshmark package had to have been delivered to the same apt #mailbox at this building and not mine  3)i have a feeling the person received the package in their mailbox. opened it and just kept it.   i went to the apt, knocked on the door one night around 8pm and then another night around 6pm and both times no one answered. now this is went my vigilante side came out. i decided to write a letter and just simply stated if you happened to have had the package in your mailbox, please shoot me a quick text message to confirm. i waited and it’s been over a month now and no answer. i just find it strange bc if this happened to me, i’d just send them a text and say no or yes.   my super mentioned it was a nice lady that lives there but nice people will do this stuff too. you just w never know who’s an ahole.   i may be wasting my time but i’m still going to occasionally pop on over and knock on the women’s door. management buildings and the police don’t give a flying f about these issues. if you have the option to find out who stole it, then you should have the right to become your own detective. package deliveries in nyc are honestly a crap shoot it will never get better- do yourself a favor, get a mailbox at ups- i moved into a new building a few months ago and everything delivered to me of value kept getting stolen. the sad thing is that your "" neighbors"" would do something so shitty i had a situation where supermarket delivery person worked in a pair with someone. people suck. someone can just go in and take your stuff. even a fedex guy could go in and take it. without a proof of personal delivery you should try to dispute it. fedex and your land rod can’t do nothing because your not the shipper. the shipper has to file a claim with fedex…. sorry to hear this. it’s a pretty common occurrence in nyc unfortunately. share a building review on openigloo so future tenants can be aware of the building security can you ask for surveillance footage to see who did it? you can take your landlord to small claims court if your lease that you signed guarantees security / security cameras.   you should have also insured your package. perhaps it came with some sort of insurance by default?   outside of that you cannot do anything but file a police report, which you should do anyway - if you do take your landlord to small claims court. but you have to somehow prove the value of the package. next time send it to a ups store and pay the package receiving fee. i did this when packages were being stolen in my building and i ordered a new phone. fedex in nyc is the worst. i called every day for like 5 days before i got anywhere so just make sure to ask to speak to a representative and don't be afraid to be assertive. damn, looks like you learned an expensive lesson. welcome to nyc! i'm so sorry this happened to you, seems like something sentimental or at least valuable to you. that really sucks and my heart actually goes out to  you  ultimately, it's not the ll's fault so it's not fair to ask them to pay for it. i wish i had better news for you why would you put the most valuable item you own in the mail? who not keep it with you? stuff gets lots or destroyed in the mail all the time if you sent it, you definitely bought insurance to cover the value of the items right? just file an insurance claim with them this is on you. you should have selected a pick up location, or rescheduled for a time you would have been home to receive it. next time plan better because this is what happens to unattended packages. hey i pm’d you! [deleted]",90,97,negative,0.608776330947876,187,"get your money back from your bank. i would get my money back from my bank. i would get my money back from my bank. sorry this happened to you. i live in new york city and it’s a huge problem. i have had numerous packages stolen in my apartment building. i have insurance and it covers theft. i would suggest posting a note in the building saying: “hi neighbors, a package was delivered but unfortunately"
186,Single Parent with 2 toddlers on Wknds: have you made a 1BR work?,"my dad did this in his one bed when my twin and i were toddlers. he had weekend custody of us so he only had to sleep in the living room two days out of the week. he didnt seem to find it too terrible but he eventually did move us to a bigger place trundle . king size bed and mats. toys but definitely the park is a must.  don't just rent at any building.. know the background of the unit / building/ neighborhood just make sure your divorce and custody papers dont explicitly state that the children must have their own bedroom and it should be ok.   buy railings for your bed and like others have said, you sleep on the couch and they can use your bed for two nights.   i don't see it becoming much of an issue until they're much older and need their own sleeping arrangements (maybe 8-9 years old).   toddlers will just be excited to be having a sleepover at dads. maybe you'll get lucky and find a place thats a 1bed plus office & tht could be their bunk beds when they're old enough. try to find a 1 bedroom with a bigger living room and get them a small bunk bed or maybe a day bed / murphy beds in nyc some renters will use the living room as an extra bedroom and put up fake walls to spit the rent with someone else. maybe you can find an apartment that has an extra space you can put up fake walls and seem the kids room we have 3 kids in a 1 bedroom apartment (full time, not divorced.) the two older kids have bunk beds in the bedroom and we have a king size murphy bed that also has a built-in couch. we ordered it on bredabeds.com. the 3rd child is a 7 month old so they sleep in a crib also in the living room with us. it definitely can work! save your money and get a 1 bedroom. 2 adults + 1 child and 3 dogs in a studio (past). lol. you got this! friends in a one bedroom got something called a roomlet put in when they had a baby, it partitioned off a small corner of their bedroom with a built in pocket door. i think there are a range of options from that to diy you could explore. i have yes. i have an 11 year old and a 5 year old full time and we had a one bed. i just sort of converted the living room for myself and gave the kids my room. i have a two bed now and share with my youngest. i'm not sure what your budget is or if you have to go into the office but astoria might work for you. you might even be able to find a jr 1 bedroom here. there are lots of families and it's definitely a more approachable neighborhood but i do notice like every neighborhood, landlords are jacking rent up so you'll need to do your research. my dad did it with a 1 bd, 1 bth with 3 girls up until we were teens. one of my sisters and i would take our dad’s bed, he would sleep on the couch and my youngest sister got the smaller couch. that place wasn’t much but we all have fond memories of it. whatever you decide, make it their space permanently. the kids should not be treated as visitors in your home. if they have space that is theirs at your ex wife’s (you mention her in your post history) home, they will eventually notice the difference at yours. treat the set up as if it is their home too. i know it may sound far fetched but i would suggest applying for the housing lottery and apply for a 2br . i’m a nurse and a single parent, and i was in the same dilemma as you. i won a 2br apt. this was something i couldn’t do on a single income. https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/publicweb/search-lotteries look on pinterest for ideas. it's totally doable. rent is too expensive. my neighbors have mom, dad, a toddler, a 5 year old, and a 1 week old in a 1 bedroom. my other neighbors have an 18 year old, mom, dad, and a 3rd grader in a 1 bedroom. it’s doable and happens a lot here. i wouldn’t say it’s ideal, but doable, especially short term. get a couch with a queen size (comfortable) pull out bed, so when your kids come over they can sleep on that. my neighbors, still married, raised 2 boys in their one bedroom. presumably they flex walled a second bedroom. i’m not in your situation but there are lots of 1beds out there that have things like dressing rooms or small dining rooms that can be converted especially in prewar buildings (but you’ll probably get fewer amenities in an older building so it’s a tradeoff).  otherwise: a good sofabed in the living room and a trundlebed or convertible bunkbed in the bedroom will make this work. children are not supposed to sleep in the living room. i lived in asia for a long time, and many cultures, people who are not even poor have children sleep in the bedroom with the parents. however, it’s been posted that if teachers hear this, that the children sleep in the living room, they need to report them for child abuse., crazy, huh? you keep the bedroom but put in a murphy bed or a trundle that slides out when they are there. keep the decor neutral and their things well organized and not too many toys and kid crap. if it’s a nice sized one bedroom you should be fine. it’s all in how you manage the space. good luck. a comfy pull out couch i suggest. when we lived in san francisco, our neighbors slept in the kitchen nook and their two kids lived in the bedroom of their rent controlled apartment. i think 4-6 nights a month is entirely doable and that you will see people getting very creative in nyc. pull out sofa in the living room and bed with railings in the bedroom. pull out sofa in the living room for you and bed with railings in the bedroom for the kids . my dad had a fairly average sized 1 bed when i was growing up in brooklyn.   granted he only had to watch 1 kid on the weekends but he would get a pull out bad for me and that worked just fine. i raised my son in a 1 bedroom on the ues for 15 years. worked out great. look for a jr4 they're really common in queens around rego park and forest hills. tag look for a spacious living room. use some kind of divider, ideally shelving, and create a permanent space for them. little children don’t need much space but crave consistency. look for ideas on pinterest. bunk murphys beds, a rug, and shelves that separate their “room” from yours is all what you need for now. i did this, built a loft bed over the sofa in the living room it will work. are the kids going to be sleeping in your bed on the weekends? i have a 2 bedroom but the kids bedroom is small so i have a camp style metal framed bunk bed for the kids that’s slightly slimmer than a twin size mattress size in their bedroom so they have more floor room to play. if your bedroom is decent sized, you can fit a full size bed in your bedroom with the bunk beds. you can always check westchester, nj, or long island out. many parents have done this with limited resources. or similar 2 brd with 2 or more kids not of the same gender.  there are some good suggestions in the comments  my mom did it once with me [only child]  when she had a studio that had a wall but no door between room and living room. my bed was a daybed in the living area in the inside corner of the living room. lol having your kids every other weekend makes your child's mother a single parent, not you. will definitely work, if you have a true one bedroom, then buy a couch that has a sleeper and pull that out for them when they visit.  alternatively i have a 6 inch trifold pad (memory foam) that i store in a closet and pull that out when kids sleep over,  it’s extremely comfortable like a bed.  i have a queen sized one for 2 kids to sleep on for sleepovers. in ny you legally are supposed to have a bedroom dedicated to the child in order to do overnights. i’m assuming it’s to enforce children having a safe space to sleep for themselves and to avoid weird bed/sleeping arrangements (although it is totally normal for parents and children to sleep together obv). but i’m upstate and nyc is like a whole different world so maybe this doesn’t apply there",93,54,neutral,0.5085523128509521,147,"a toddler, a 5 year old, and a 3 year old in a 1 bedroom.a bed and a bed and a bed and a couch and a bed and a bed and a bed and a bed and a bed and a bed and a bed and a bed and a bed and a couch and a bed and a bed and a couch and a bed and a bed and"
187,Is there any hope in staying in nyc?? $1k-1.7k budget,"fuck your landlord just stay. especially if you have until new years.   no way you get an apartment for under 1.5k living alone in nyc unless you’re in flushing, ridgewood, flatbush or the bronx. and it’ll probably be a basement unit with a fee. and even then it’ll be tough.   you’d have to know someone personally who has off market deals. a room? sure. a whole place? i’m not too certain. hold the phone, i’m sure you want to move out of home and start anew, but your landlord cannot raise your rent (beyond the board approved annual rs increase, around 2.5%) and so long as you have been living there for two consecutive years up until right now, you do have every right to take over the lease.   taking over the lease doesn’t mean having to stay there for the rest of your life.  you could always just sign a one year lease and use that time to try to find a golden opportunity that fits in your budget (which is still a stretch, but buying extra time can’t hurt).  that’s just my two cents.  edit:  i just saw in another comment how you’re already on the lease (kudos to you/your parents, it’s hard to get someone added to a rs lease), so you can disregard the whole lease takeover thing. you can stay in that apartment and it’s required to have the same legal rent your parents paid. call 311 if you have questions and read up on your rights. also check the address on justfix.nyc — you should get a new lease every year too. the housing lottery is a resource but legit could take years, if it happens at all. doesn’t hurt to start applying though: https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/publicweb/. keep the apartment and rent out a room. you’ll be ahead in the long run. if your apartment is rent stabilized or rent controlled (i forget what’s the difference) and you’ve been living there for more than 2 years with proof such as listing the residence on your state id or drivers license, paying bills addressed to the apartment or old leases in which you are named a occupant, you can apply for a succession of the lease and take over the lease with same rent increases as if your parents were signing it. i would let your landlord know you plan to succeed the lease and see if they let you renew the lease under your name. be warned not every landlord plays nice and they may have you go through housing court to prove your succession but it’s well worth it to lock in housing at a reduced cost to yourself. i went through something similar when my parents moved out of my childhood apartment and i wanted to take over the lease with the same rate my parents would’ve gotten if they stayed. do not leave that apartment. you’re so lucky to have a stabilized two bedroom in your budget, let your parents know you’ll stay in the apartment once they leave and if you’re already on the lease, there is nothing to discuss with the landlord. just pay rent and bills like they would. i empathize with you, i’m in the same boat. nyc native, 23, housing is killer for us. i don’t understand why it’s not a thing to ensure housing for people born in their states, it’s so unfair and disgusting being forced out by rich people who pay $47 a month for a four bedroom in bumfuck nowhere… i would say stay where you are because there’s no chance in hell you’ll find an apartment for that much. your landlord can’t do anything about it. it’s your place, your lease. wouldn't you be grand fathered in? it sounds like you can probably just stay on your current lease (given you’re already on it) but just my two cents as another nyc native: living with roommates is a pretty reasonable expectation at 22 and will generally make your life a lot better.   i moved out of my mom’s place in brooklyn at 22 and in with 3 friends and it afforded us a bigger kitchen, living space, etc - way more than i could have had i been renting alone (which i doubt i could have afforded anyway). i don’t think being a nyc native exempts you from this part of life, and this is the best way point blank for low income people to stay in new york. you’ll otherwise end up spending your whole salary on rent / barely enjoy the city, which is really no way to live. consider finding friends to share a place with you if possible! to repeat what others have said. if it’s rent stabilized and you’re on the lease, your ll can’t legally remove you or jack up the rent beyond the allowed annual increase.  i understand your desire for a change since the current place doesn’t seem great, but if you refuse to have roommates, and at your budget, staying at your current place seems by far the best option. if your rent is stabilized and you are on the lease because you have been living there you get to take over the lease. the apartment is stabilized. you are fine. continue to renew the lease. maybe try to find a roommate. someone in your situation that's trying to save money. good luck. but you are in a good spot. don't give it up. staten island yeah, i always go to the two-year renewal. he’s probably willing to pay you a substantial amount of money at a minimum to be bought out of your rent stabilized lease wouldn’t recommend leaving though. parkchester apartments are super cheap too there’s crazy tiny apartments on st marks place for 1100. there are a lot of rooms on facebook market place for 800-1k.   but it sounds like you can probably stay at your spot for a while longer. get a job waiting tables that is my best advice. one of the most accessible high paying job ls in the city do not move out [removed] get a new job. nyc is expensive because people who stay here have to work for it. that’s not impossible as nyc is also a city of opportunity. build up your skills, keep a growth mindset, and climb. it’s called the rat race for a reason. otherwise nyc is goddamn near impossible on that budget w/o roommates. can't you just get roommates? i've seen 4 people living in a studio so i'm sure it's possible, just not desirable best bet is a basement apartment in a house somewhere in queens but even then you’re probably looking at $2k minimum. you should be able to get a room in the bronx on your budget. said here many times, but i would stay in your current apartment. you are legally entitled to it, and there are plenty of tenant rights organizations that can help. i left a rent stabilized apartment like 10 years ago and regret it all the time. future you will be glad you stayed. just stay. absolutely just stay. do whatever you have to to stay. don’t you have a claim to keep that apartment since you’re a family member? you can reach out to the department of housing to confirm that your building and exact apartment is rent stabilized. in addition, they’ll let you know how much the rent can be raised and how much the rent has been over the years. they also keep a record of all tenants. it’s not that simple for the landlord to raise your rent especially for that long. keep up with rent, if the landlord decides on going to housing court to raise your rent, the case is more in your favor since you more than likely have succession rights to the unit. take a look around inwood if you’re apartment is actually rent stabilized then the landlord can’t kick you out or raise rent more than what is legally allowed. the best is to stay in the current apt. i used to live near aburndale station bsmt of a house, had 1 bedroom for about a year. i paid 1200 a month. got the rent from heykorean.com it is mostly for koreans but some are willing to take non korean renters as well. renters insurance was 13 a  month. so look into aburndale as a last resort. no way will you find your own apartment while only making $21 an hour. i get it roommates suck but i make way more than that and live with roommates. nevertheless, your landlord cannot increase your rent by more than 2.5% iirc and you have the right to stay there if you are on the lease. i would not leave you will not find anything better.  also no offense try finding a better paying job. i graduated college during covid and was depressed and unemployed for over a year, so i get it but i have friends who work in the service industry and they make a lot more than $21/h. my other friend from high school is a doorman and he makes $30/h and their starting pay is $27.75 right now, it's a chill job. you are worth way more than your current pay. good luck, i hope everything works out for you!! if it is stabilized, you have a right to stay. first successor to an original lease gets no increase. be ready to prove you’ve lived there for over two years and have the docs that prove your parents are your parents. sorry, but studios themselves are $1,700+ now. you will not find anything in your price range unless you look to rent a room in an apartment with other people.   you need to have more realistic expectations, especially since you've been disillusioned living with your parents in a rent-stabilized unit.  eastern queens is your best bet for affordability, but you'll still be paying more than $1,200-$1,500. i know queens well, 1.5-1.7k for a studio or 1 bedroom is the current rate in maspeth, middle village, glendale, elmhurst, woodside, sunnyside, potentially ridgewood nope, this is the land of the rich. new york likes to show the country and the world that it's liberal, but in reality it's run by wall street. i'm getting the fuck out next year. if your in a rent stabalized placed, your land lord doesn't have a lot of options to raise rent and has to offer you lease renewal. you will not find a better deal then that.  no i don't think your budget is realistic, except maybe in the bronx or far into queens/brooklyn. why cant you stay? i dont know if flushing is all that cheap… you don’t have to move. your landlord cannot raise rent in any meaningful way beyond the annual increases determined by the rent guidelines board. you just need to make sure you get added to the lease. don’t tell your landlord your parents are moving. just say they’re traveling. don’t ever give up a rent controlled apartment. if you go to this site you can order a report on whether it’s rent stabilized. they will mail it to your address. though if it says that it’s not registered, that could be wrong. if it says it is registered then it almost certainly is. click the link then go to “order apartment rent history” https://www.justfix.org/en/",88,121,neutral,0.5626453161239624,209,"i would say stay. it’s your place, your lease.. i’m a nyc native and i’m in the same boat. i’m not a landlord. i’m a renter. i’m a renter. i’m a renter. i’m a renter. i’m a renter. i live in a"

191,Landlord asking me to swap rent stabilized apartments - what are my options?,"well you could tell him no lol you're rent stabilized, entitled to renewals and he can't do much about it. i guess the only downside is you'll likely go to the end of the priority list on anything repair related going forward.  or you can take it but give him a number. make it sweet but not insulting. something you can sleep with at night. he'll likely bite.   he's only offering you the second option out of sheer necessity, not as a favor. he can't force you out so he's trying to dangle fruit.  personally i'd tell him i'm not interested unless the numbers made very very good sense and even then...not sure your personal life but if you planned on expanding the household in any way your current layout is more ideal. i have a friend who was negotiating with the landlord to vacate their rent stabilized small 1-br and the amount was more than $100k. hope it helps you’re putting the landlords feelings and wants above your own. in a rent stabilized unit, you must be given a lease renewal year after year. you don’t need to move. you're not obligated to move, you don't owe your landlord a favor lol simple. if you don’t want to move, contact an attorney. he can’t make you move to create another monster apartment in an already over saturated market. those apartments are just for college students with guarantor parents and they don’t stay long and contribute nothing to the community. keep the 2 bedroom. it doesn’t matter if you got the apartment as a favor, you’re legally entitled to lease renewals every year for the rest of your life as others have said, you do not need to move.   as you have noted, if you don't cooperate with your landlord, they could make it difficult for you in other ways. it isn't right but it's hard to prove they are doing anything in retribution.   they should absolutely pay for movers, and i have gotten this in a similar situation before. you can probably negotiate more, including rent credits, an even cheaper rent, a handyman to help with shelving etc after the move, and even more. make a reasonable list, look it over, know what things you'd be willing to strike, and then submit it to the landlord. they stand to profit big time from this--you can ask for a good amount and probably get it. you don’t have to move! everyone gets apartments through luck and friends, there’s nothing wrong with that and you have no reason to feel grubby about it. but if you do, ask for them to move you, put up shelves, paint, all the things, and also for let’s say $40k for your trouble. then negotiate. take whatever you get and invest it towards your future. invest the difference between the rents as well. you’ll lose a view but gain future stability. it is illegal for a landlord to combine two rent stabilized apartments to convert them to market rate. what your landlord is proposing is illegal. he cannot do that.  do not accept his offer!   https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/2024/brian-kavanagh/what-end-frankenstein-loophole-means-nyc-renters it’s not unreasonable to ask for a six figure sum to agree to this. you have the right to remain in that unit for the rest of your life, and your children would also probably get to keep it to. [deleted] you don’t need to move and don’t owe the landlord anything. if you are seriously considering it, ask for something more comparable to your apartment and /or a large buyout.  pretty sure you can only get a 2 year lease at most if you’re stabilized, but they will have to keep renewing you anyway. you need to reach out to a lawyer who knows rs and buyouts. my landlord offered me $75k just to take 8 feet of my entry hallway. he offered $350k for my neighbor in a two bedroom to leave pre covid. they also tried to get me to move to a smaller unit that was renovated and i said no.   do not give up that 2 bedroom. and if you do, negotiate enough to buy a 2 bedroom in the neighborhood you are living. if you move, you're contributing to the housing crisis by allowing your landlord to destabilize two apartments. is this for real or are you trolling? why are you moving if you don't want to? makes no sense to me. if you have a lease, he can't make yo you leave. he is also legally obliged to offer you a lease renewal. i would kill for a stabilized two bedroom! i'm not going to lie... going from 2 bedrooms to 1 is a big ask. i'm with everyone else. tell him you'll move if something of equal is available. simple. you can ask for a comparable rent stabilized unit at at the same rent or lower.  rent stabilized leases come in 1 or 2 year options.  he can reduce the rent on any rent stabilized unit.  it is called preferential rent.  the rent increases are all based on the preferential rent until you leave.  look to get same type of unit at 10 to 15% less. if he has an attorney you should consult with one too.  ask him to pay. could you thank him for kind offer and gently state that your view and ample storage would be difficult to move state from.  that you would be willing to look at other units with those two features.  i would not outright decline moving, he had other buildings and may have a unit that had those features. but if you switch will it make you market? please contact an attorney don’t do it he’s trying to destabilize the apartment and your stuck in some closet that he will eventually raise your rent id ask for 200k, the 5 year lease you mentioned and more. in that 5 year lease id demand that the market rent be registered as not going up.  the apartment you are moving into is rent stabilized for whoever moves into it so the landlord isn't losing anything there.  but, they will be benefitting a ton from you vacating. you deserve a big piece of that. if you don't want to move, you can decline or hold out for something better. you can also hold out for monetary compensation for the inconvenience. your landlord is not your friend. your landlord is not your friend. your landlord is not your friend. you don't owe him shit. it's a business contract. you accomplish nothing by feeling ""grubby.""  the only reason that you should consider this is if it's advantageous to you. get a buy out big enough buyout to make it so. if he makes more than one buyout offer in a six month period, he is guilty of harassment.  if he offers you a preferential rent, make sure it's actually a preferential rent and not a ""net-effective"" or some other loophole that these clowns come up with to circumvent the law.  i repeat - your landlord is not your friend. don’t move. [deleted] i wouldn’t move haha shoot for the moon, or just stay.  it is your right personally i would tell him to kick rocks. mostly because i refuse to help anyone deregulate an apartment, and because you would be losing out on a lot.   that said, you should be pushing for a buy out. in my experience, typically giving up a rent stabilized apartment is worth $75k+.   as for the rent of the new apartment, i would insist that it be cheaper per square foot than the current place. it’s a 19% reduction in space. plus loss of a good view. it could be worth trying to find a market rate building in the area to see how losing that view affects the rent amount on the open market. but considering both of those things i would push for a rent at least 30% cheaper than the current place. locking in a low preferential rent to start will mean those (bi)annual rent increases will take awhile to build up.   if you decide to tell him to kick rocks, start documenting his treatment before and after these negotiations. things like, 1) how quickly do repairs get done, 2) how responsive to you reaching out, 3) have you had issues with heat before and after.  if you feel the ll is treating you worse you could bring a harassment claim, which could net you $1k per incident of harassment.  also, negotiate in writing as much as possible. preferably email, but text works too (they’re just harder to save and show as evidence). don’t throw rock on your foot sounds like youre set on moving. i would ask for no rent for 1-2 months so you could transition to new place. he would need to renovate kitchen and bathroom, repaint , finish on floors etc.. any custom work you want done ask for it now.  this could be a plus since the rent is cheaper.  if not, then tell him you’re happy and staying put. this is negotiation , you have the leverage and you have nyc gov behind you. don't move.    simple as that.    you are not getting a better dealer. less money but also less space.    stay where you are. he cannot make you move.. seems so wrong combining these apts to destablize..   they are being filled w like 5 students having parties.. at least in my bldg in east village .. we need more small apts and studios in nyc. you don’t need an attorney.  this is the simplest situation in the world:  you can have whatever you want. do you not at all want to deal with moving? you can say no. is there something that would make you happy to move? ask for it! heck, ask for more.  the literal only “mistake” you can make is to ask for so much that you piss off your land lord. you’re definitely not doing it for free, nor are you doing it if you don’t want to, because you’ve been advised that’s a mistake.  so ask for whatever makes you happy to move! a month of free rent, he covers the movers, a fixed rate for a few years, whatever makes you happy. don’t take advantage if you intend to stay long term, but obviously make sure it’s a win/win!  sounds like a lucky situation to me, if you’re willing to give up the empire state view. you can say no but you can also negotiate some kind of move-out agreement where he pays you a certain amount to move. why not ask for $10k if it’s so valuable to him lol he can’t give you a rent stabilized lease for more than 2 years.  i would double check that this other apartment is rent stabilized (you can file a request at dhcr for that information) and ask for a 2 year rent stabilized lease if everything looks ok. you should also ask for your expenses related to moving to be covered. maybe $10,000 to $15,000? buyouts for rent stabilized apartments are hard now, but if he’s benefiting from this, he should at least make your life easier. you should definitely not move. you should probably contact a lawyer either way before you do anything. lots of things could go wrong for you here even if you agree to move. your being screwed and your stupid if you do this. you basically have a unit you could stay in for life, since its a two bedroom. most landlords would have to pay a lot to get you to move. i'd just politely decline. ask for a comparable apartment. same size 2 bedrooms renovated; similiar or lower price. if you end up with a wife/family it’s much easier in a 2 bedroom vs a 1 bedroom.  do you plan on staying in the city long term? i wouldn’t give it up. dude what u have is literally unmatched. so many cons with the other apartment. eastern exposure is gonna be so frustrating during the day trying to not get ur retinas burnt by the sun. moving to a shittier apartment isnt worth it. clearly, he knows he can’t do much about this apartment and wants to dump it onto you. also, even if u don’t have a lot, i’d bet you’d have to throw so much away to fit a smaller apartment. it’s just not worth the hassle and cons imo. you should stay. even if he becomes hostile, the law is in your favor and can shut him up if he tries to pull anything. and the favor thing doesn’t matter because you’re paying your rent fully and not causing any issues. you’re a tenant, not a friend doing a favor. and he’s a landlord, and will never be a friend. this is quite literally so easy, get him to renovate your new 1 bedroom unit before you make the switch, then he can take yours. cheaper rent, new remodel (obviously not a full gut reno but make it nice), and boom you came out on top and youre on the ll good side. win win rent stabilized leases are max 2 years, so you couldn’t lock in longer.   the guy can’t force you out if you really don’t want to move and sounds like you have a very good gig- if you are promoted in a few years will the cost be easier? even if right now is difficult?  i wouldn’t give a 2 bed like that up. the others are right though that he may be unwilling to fix things in the apartment- prepare for that.   if you do decide to move, i’d first find out what rent they actually want to charge- see if he will take more off because you are allowing him to profit a lot more. try the nonprofit uhab for help. do not move! the big plus about a two bedroom in a rent stabilized building is that if the worst happens and you lose your job, you can live very comfortably with a roommate (there are far fewer restrictions on who you can live with and what you can charge when it is a roommate situation rather than a sublet situation).   seriously, a two bedroom rent stabilized apartment lease when you only need one bedroom is a virtual guarantee that you can never be priced out of nyc no matter how badly you fall on your ass.   the other thing is, stop feeling guilty that you lucked out! i am sure your landlord is still profiting off of whatever you are paying him, even after paying the building's expenses. giving your great apartment back to your landlord isn't going to make him like you.   oh, he might be nice for a teensy little while for a few months after you agreed to the switch, but you will still be paying less than market rate for a desirable apartment and you will be an even bigger thorn in his side than the old lady in the nursing home because you aren't as apt to die and create a vacancy.   note: i know that to some people the notion that you might ever need to share your apartment for financial reasons is inconceivable but believe me, even when you do everything right in terms of living modestly and savings it is still possible to lose everything in the united states.   also bear in mind that when you have the lease to a rent stabilized apartment you very much have your choice of roommates. you could hold out and only share with a flight attendant or a medical intern or somebody with the opposite hours to yours so you will mostly be there alone. just say no if you don't want to do it.   the ball is in your court. landlord tenant lawyer here. if you are truly rent stabilised you don't have to move for any reason whatsoever, ever except in very very rare and narrow circumstances as long as you aren't breaking your lease and you pay your rent. in fact the laws have recently changed that most tenants are now entitled to release renewals and can only be evicted for good cause (if you're landlord owns more than 10 residential units- that is apts not buildings.)   you would be crazy to move without a substantial some of money being paid to you for the value of your apartment alone not to mention the inconvenience as well as a much cheaper rent at the smaller apartment. you should be getting a significant amount of money in addition to the new apt. you have leverage as they can’t move you out. at an absolute minimum you can charge half the rent to a roommate, so that’s it’s worth to you, though the market value difference is higher. i’d ask them to cover the entire move. as in hire movers and take care of everything on both sides of the move, including the cleaning of your current apartment and basically setting up your new apartment.  also while waiting to hear what the new rent will be, determine how much you would like it to be based on what you’re losing in the move. then when they finally disclose that info, you’ll at least be ready to negotiate for even lower rent if necessary. what your landlord is trying to do doesn’t make sense. you can’t combine apartments to destabilize them, you can’t even destabilize apartments anymore through renovations and rent increases. he can only increase the rent by a very limited amount from renovations and it stays stabilized forever. what i’m guessing is that he wants the bigger apartment for himself or a family member. he can’t legally make you move, you have a right to lease renewals forever but if for whatever reason you decide to take the offer, please make sure the new apartment is also stabilized by getting the rent history from dhcr. also, although i don’t think you can get five year leases on stabilized apartments a even better option is tell him you want a preferential rent (whatever rent you want to pay) and have it listed as the preferential rent in the lease. your lease renewals will be based off the preferential rent not the legal rent so you will basically be paying that negotiated preferential rent price with regulated increases until you move out. are you planning to ever have a family? once you have a partner and you want to expand, bye bye rent stabilized one bed room apartment. at least with a 2 bedroom, you'll have more time to stay there if you had 2 kids. is there a storage room in the basement? or an area that’s able to be converted to an office for you?  you can balk at the move as it would severely affect your life, but if you had a separate room in the basement or perhaps on the first floor, or access to the roof for a roof top patio for yourself only to use, then you can give up your 2 bedroom. don't do it, you can grow in that other apartment whereas you can in the current. i had a friend who did this in stuy town, and they got to move into a fully renovated unit for the same rent. they’ve been paying the same price since the early 2000s i think. objectively i think you should refuse to move to preserve the amount of rent stabilized units in your building. they are hard to come by and a lifeline for hard working new yorkers.  many have disappeared and the rising rents have a direct corellation with increased homelessness/ housing instability. if you do decide to move you could try and negotiate a lower preferential rent and then they can only add the legally mandated % every year based on the lower preferential rent. alternatively you could ask for a stipend/rebate equivalent to several months of rent to offset your moving costs, time for packing and unpacking, painting, etc. i have the opposite issue. i'm in a rent stabilized apartment in brooklyn and would like to move to a slightly smaller and cheaper unit on the same floor to save a bit on rent. i've contacted the management about this on numerous occasions and they keep stalling and saying they don't know what they want to do with the unit. it feels like they want to keep it unoccupied for a certain period of time so that they can deregulate it and rent it out at a market rate (which is illegal i think).  if anyone on here has any input on what to do in such a situation and how it might be possible to convince the management to allow me to exchange rent stabilized apartments please let me know. first, you should absolutely speak to a lawyer. second, since you are making a big accommodation, ll at the least should pay all your moving costs plus $5k for the hassle. second, if he’s such a big ll, request he moves you to another 2 bedroom. you are allowed to take your rent stabilized status with you to non stabilized apartment if you are accommodating ll. lastly, since he is offering you accommodation, he does have leverage. people here saying you owe him nothing: that’s not entirely true if he is making reasonable accommodation for you. speak to a l&t lawyer. talk to a lawyer who deals with this. they will have much. are experience and be able to guide you through the process i would do this honestly. unless you think you’d be happy in the one bedroom for a long long time. the 2br stabilized is a lot to give up. who cares what he wants. act in your best interest just move. else, your landlord will find a way to kick you out. 30% of market value already ha",86,116,neutral,0.529086172580719,202,"you're contributing to the housing crisis by allowing your landlord to destabilize two apartments. is this for real or are you trolling?

196,Looking for a way to occasionally avoid the commute home to NJ,"you should probably list what you're willing to pay a lot of people on craigslist housing (rooms/shares) would probably be willing to arrange this kind of accommodation. they’re usually older residents who have a spare room in their apartment, and it’s usually a student or commuter situation. in ib at 50 isn't the hotel worth the convenience and not having to deal with the uncertainty nap pods in midtown. 8 hours is $70 https://therestroom.co/home there's some people who might be willing to let you crash on their couch for that price range, but otherwise you're likely to be stuck paying the rent of a bedroom if you want your own room. [menno house](https://mennohouse.org/short-term-guests/) might be of interest to you. good luck! it will be cheaper for you to get a hotel room. i can't see someone beating a hotel price unless they: 1. had horrible credit/can't beat the 40x rent requirement by a lot and can't get a guarantor. = super risky person to be on a lease with.  2. is either moving from out of state (no nyc paycheck yet, only offer letter) or overseas (same paycheck problem & no us credit score) = less risk but still hard to find. 3. willing to have you on a futon/air mattress in the living room for your ~4 nights a month. = i can't see that as being comfortable at anything past 23 years old and doesn't meet the door requirement. i'm confused - this just doesn't seem to make sense.  if you're in your 50s, working for an investment bank - you must be an md pulling north of $1m a year?  i don't know your home life but whether you are single or have a family, it just seems odd that you'd be okay not having your own space in the city. with your income, why not buy a studio or one bedroom in the city and hold as an investment piece? hi, is harlem okay? my apartment is in harlem not sure about your industry, but i do know a lot of people with 2+hr commutes to the city. some of them rent full apartments, split between 3-5 people, and will all use it as a crash pad when they're working in the city.  they're mostly older guys with houses and families in ct/pa/upstate, who want to avoid the 4+hr round trip commute without paying for hotels every time, so a similar situation to yours.  that way it's almost always occupied, but usually not by all the residents at the same time. if it is, they all have an equal claim to it, and will just deal with that for a few nights max. might be worth looking into if some coworkers would be interested in a similar arrangement (or opposite, they might want a place to stay in the city on the weekend). dm if interested. i have a place that could work for you. in that show mad men the gentleman had an apartment with a lady friend. huh i was thinking of something similar…wonder if there was a third we could get our own maybe? my dad may be interested in this. he has a 3 bedroom in the city and is reliable. feel free to direct message me. i'm curious, if you work in an investment bank, why are you trying to shave off 200 a month? lol  i would just use a hotel room. much more convenient and probably just as cheap. i’d look at hostels. many have private rooms if a dorm situation is not for you. you maybe could work something out with management for storage of an extra pair of shoes, toiletries, etc so you don’t have to bring them every time. maybe check out couchsurfing or a hostel [removed] this looks promising for 560.  beware of scams.  https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/roo/d/new-york-spacious-furnished-room-in/7773335278.html nap york! i’ve always wanted to try. https://napyork.com i feel like what you want is hotel tonight?? you can look up rooms open in the city for the night and find a cheap rate. they’re not always super low but can def find under $200, and a lot easier than finding this unicorn setup.   i did have a roommate setup like this in one of my first apartments but it’s more likely in a tech/founder oriented city like sf i think. my roommate was a startup founder who rented the second room to her founder friend and we’d have a rando employee from that friend’s satellite office come stay a few days every 2-3 weeks. it was fine in that i was broke as hell/always at work anyway and got to have a bathroom mostly to myself since my main roommate was in the master, but also weird in that i’d come home and be like “oh another random older man, hopefully he isn’t a creep or a murderer.” i bounced from that situation p fast and i can’t imagine most people would want to stay in it mid/long term tbh. get a hotel instead and sign up for bonuses and points or credit cards.  you’ll get a few nights free through that. holiday in express etc will be affordable sounds like you need a girl who likes visitors for an evening or too? or maybe a guy? i used to live in newark before i came back to nyc and always worked nights, so i know the struggle. if its only mon-wed, would 200-225 a week [75/night] be okay? and is there a particular area of manhattan you're looking for? did you check [couch surfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/)? how about a futon? i have a friend who had split an apartment with someone with a similar deal. however, my friend who lived in the 2br full time paid 75% of the rent, and the friend who was there probably ~4-5 days a month paid 25%. that’s probably what most people would be willing to offer seems like this would be a good ask for your network or a post on posh on bloomberg. i’m sure people have guest bedrooms in the line of work. agree with most folks here that it’d be tough to find someone that has the availability for an extra roommate but is not desperate enough they need the cash. maybe someone with a consulting role that travels a lot of something. it's smart of you to make this thread and shows your resourcefulness. i'll say if it were me and i were in the ib field, i'd either try to negotiate higher pay to compensate for the hotels i'd like to book or book the hotel anyway because i feel financially secure enough. i think at this stage of your career you might end up valuing comfort more than you realize to keep the train going. just my two cents. best of luck. assuming this is cause you work late, wouldn’t your firm just pay for an uber home? where do you live in nj? even if you find an arrangement in the city, the commute can be 20 minutes minimum if it's from midtown to downtown, etc. at that, you should just hotel or rent a room by path into wtc and your commute time would probably be similar. i would post in neighborhood fb group of where you’d like to live https://www.thepodhotel.com/pod-times-square or i would look into crash pads for airline crews in astoria/ forest hills. you get a bunk bed at $300-400 a month. usually you are in a room alone because of everyone’s random schedules. find someone with an opposing schedule and split an apartment. or find someone to take a room the days you don’t. i’d actually be interested in an apartment for like fri-monday. maybe something would work out. i’m in dumbo, this could work for me until september i have a house in astoria queens right around the corner from the subway.  i wouldn't mind someone staying in the spare guest room if i could also change the arrangement for the weeks when the room is needed for my guests.  i don't think this would be a good fit for you op as you work in downtown but this could work for folks in midtown. how many days a week do you need to be there, specifically? you can easily find and rent a room in a roommate situation but you’ll still have to pay your portion of the rent. should be super easy to find a room for 1200 in places near columbia and above omg just buy another apartment as an investment",85,131,neutral,0.4666084349155426,216,"i think you should look into nap york. i’m in my 50s and working for an investment bank. i’m thinking of something similar. i’m confused - this just doesn't seem to make sense. if you're working for an investment bank, why are you trying to shave off 200 a month?

197,Finding a room has been the most soul crushing experience,"i'm not able to help. but i'm curious about your budget and where you've been looking? i am also going through this right now. i have driven this weekend -alone- to six different rooms just for them to have lied to me about some shit about the room or apartment and did not mention the one liner deal breaker until i got there .    for example they’ll tell me in messages that they’re willing to remove the furniture and then when i’m viewing the room, tell me that they’re not willing to remove the furniture,   or one girl yesterday very well knew i was looking for long-term housing and then waited to the end of the tour of the room to tell me she’s only actually trying to rent it for three months because her friend is coming from out of state and needs a place.  the amount of time , gas, headache, and bullshit i have dealt with is insane . like it should not have to be this hard. i’m asking all these questions upfront before i schedule to view sooo the least people can do is answer honestly.   i’m honestly convinced i will not be able to find a place after looking for a month, and i have 15 days to move out if you're not on there already, try listingsproject. there may not be an avalanche of responses but the ones you do get will be quality. i've used them a few times for work and short term rent postings, both seeking and offering, and they're pretty nice. i don’t have any advice but i almost wrote this exact same post the other day!!!   it’s been horrible. worst seeking housing experience in nyc so far for me.   especially all the “look at my cute lil poodle paddy, no other pets”, people.  had 3 potential roommates fall through: 1st i could tell was high strung/controlling - i cut it off, even though the apartment was literally amazing. second flaked on me the day of the showing!!! third, met completely randomly but no longer interested in the neighborhood.   finally got approved for an apartment as a single applicant, only because the first applicant took 36 hours to respond and the landlord was pissed off.   by the grace of god i was 2nd in line.   i have no advice. but i feel you. also if people could take down their listings on fb if they found someone it would be superrrrrrr helpful. i saw the title in my notifications and said amen  i just visited a beautiful room in a duplex with other female students in my budget in jersey city and the landlord said he was just about to email me the lease. and he completely ghosted me. never replied to my follow up text or call are you able to get an apartment yourself then rent out rooms? i was fed up being in your end and decided to just get a place and find housemates. i had to get my friend to ghost cosign bc my salary at the time was 85k which didn’t meet the 30x level ugh, i feel this! the place i was supposed to move into when i first moved here rescinded their offer because their friend wanted the spot, so i had to rush to find a new one. fun times.   i'm in an especially tight position now because i'm only working part-time at the moment and don't know if a full-time offer will come from somewhere here in the city or elsewhere, which makes me hesitant to sign a lease anyway. i'm thinking i'll continue with month to month subletting but that limits my options so much. gotta find something somehow, though, since i'm due to move in three weeks.   best of luck to you, i hope you find a great place very soon! the apartment i stayed at (lease expires this sundays)...its on crown heights. i paid 1350 for a bathroom with 2 other roommates that have their own bathroom. i found my own apartment and have been spammed with messages from aganets asking to see the apartment. last year when i moved to the city i applied with the only person who responded to my inquiries. hardest year my life because the room was over budget for me and i was truly living paycheck to paycheck. roommate wasn't the best either. hey! i have 3bhk available in harlem! i have a room posted up on reddit. i mean. you could come see it. it is a sublet for the first two months and then you'd hve to sign the lease. just saying. awesome bushwick location. roommates are meh but not the worst. just throwing that out there. when i was searching i would get into the bath every night and have a good cry. it was that bad. the euphoria of finally finding a place was the highest of highs - i hope you’ll experience that soon! sorry to hear that. honestly though you guys can’t all be fighting to live in like 4 neighborhoods. nyc is big. i know it’s not cool to live anywhere besides park slope at the moment but if you’re willing to widen your search to other boroughs the search actually becomes doable. and no it’s not 1975 anymore you won’t get mugged walking down the street in the bronx. i've had some luck with spareroom and paying for their subscription to be the first people to respond to an ad. i think people get tired after the 10th person to contact them. i’ve been looking for over 2 months. no luck. i want to die. it shouldn’t be this hard. it is very dehumanizing. where i live there are so many empty apartments and we still can’t find a room or apartment that will get us out of the hole we have found ourselves in. our experience has been so dehumanizing, it’s hard to understand how we can be two respectable, caring, and supportive people and are treated like garbage by family. then we got landlords who hoard spaces and rent to the highest bidder. using the empty spaces as play pieces on a game board as if having a safe place to lay your head down at night isn’t part of the human experience [deleted]",84,43,negative,0.791920006275177,127,i was living paycheck to paycheck.it! i have a room posted up on reddit! i have a room posted up on fb! i have a room posted up on reddit! i have a room posted up on reddit! i have a room posted up on reddit! i have a room posted up on reddit! i have a room posted up on
198,Why does Zillow seem to have more apartments than StreetEasy in the cheaper 2000-2500 range.,"streeeasy has listing validation, and zillow does not.   getting banned from zillow for running a $2250 scam is fun and easy. anyone can do it. but streeteasy requires real estate agent / listing / landlord validation, so there are less scams.   maybe this has changed in recent years, idk. but i know i do know that streeteasy doesn’t let you make an account without a real estate license or something like that. lol two people commented, where one dude is saying it's because zillow is legit, and the other dude is saying it's because zillow is not legit.   sums up the state of reddit about right. street easy is super over priced. it's basically just for people who have no connections in the city and don't understand how the city works. nearly every posting on there is linked to a broker. it's much easier and you get a better deal by reaching out directly to management companies. if you see an ad for apartment rentals on the side of a building, give them a call. even if that specific building isn't to your liking, the management company likely manages other buildings and has the knowledge of whose lease is expiring when. as with everything in nyc, you get better deals through old school avenues like cold calling, and door knocking than you ever will through an app or website. same works for food delivery. call an old school restaurant for delivery and you can feed a family for $20, but if you use uber eats it will be over $100.  same thing when it comes to real estate. ads for rented apts coming down quickly on se because the ads are expensive as a broker you can’t list directly on zillow in most neighborhoods. you’d have to advertise on streeteasy for $7 per day per listing and then it syndicates to zillow. however, in “non-prime” neighborhoods like southern and eastern brooklyn, central and eastern queens, staten island and northern bronx, brokers can advertise directly on zillow for free, so often brokers just advertise on zillow only.  typically those neighborhoods have cheaper apartments and that’s probably why you’re seeing zillow with a larger amount of $2000-$2500 listings. it's because the zillow listings are not updated and maintained, so they're just stale/old and no longer available  wow, so many completely misinformed people like to act like experts here lol scaaaaam!! i’ve found 3/4 nyc apartments on zillow. one i found on craigslist. i find zillow the best always zillow has a ton of postings but june which basically make it unusable and the price is smaller since it's room only. zillow is more known and has no extensive price history like streeteasy [deleted] craigslist is the way to go. way more likely to find something without a brokers fee. streeteasy is sure to come with a brokers fee.   source: rented my current apartment via craigslist, as did numerous other people in my friend circle. streeteasy charges agents $6 per day to put up their listings. this is especially costly for an agent with a listing at a lower price point. agents with listings below $2500 will try to find other, less costly platforms to advertise on. it costs money to list on streeteasy ($5 per day) but zillow is free. more cheapos and scams. less people use zillow = less offers taken off the market",85,26,neutral,0.5181916952133179,111,"zillow is free. streeteasy is expensive, but zillow is free. more cheapos and scams. zillow is free. more people use zillow = less offers taken off the market. more cheapos and scams. less people use zillow = less offers taken off the market. i've found apartments on zillow, but i've also found them on streeteasy. i find zillow the"
199,Where should I live with a 5-7k budget? Working at World Trade Center,"are you single? if yes, and your budget is $5-$7k per month, you’ll want to live in the west village or tribeca. maybe hudson square or soho are options too. just aim to be close to grocery stores and you’ll be fine. lastly as an fyi, battery park city is a lot of families so i don’t know if that fits into your “new chapter”. best of luck! west village if you wanna stay in manhattan. if you’re open to super trendy outside of manhattan neighborhood with the most amazing views and super easy commute to manhattan then dumbo/brooklyn heights! was going to say brooklyn heights/cobble hill as well! close to 2,3,4,5,r,a,c,f which will get you to fidi and really a lot of other places. a plethora of grocery stores, restaurants and dog parks as well as the bk promenade for great and safe walks i’ve lived in the west village and in battery park. both are awesome, but completely different. battery park is more family oriented and friendlier. it is quiet, extremely clean, well maintained, and convenient to just about every subway line (~10 min walk). it feels like a suburb within a busy city. i loved living there. it’s great with a dog, there are at least four dog parks within an easy walk. you have access to two whole foods and eataly. there aren’t as many great restaurants nearby but you can walk to tribeca or elsewhere downtown.  you’ll get less for your money in the west village or tribeca. both have a charm and sophistication factor that battery park doesn’t really have (just because it’s newer). there are fewer grocery stores, but more good restaurants. you can walk to great shopping and it’s convenient to other areas downtown. it’s a busier area, there are more homeless people, and the subways are not quite as accessible as battery park. i live on uws near an express subway stop and work near wtc. less than 30 min commute, which is generally pretty reliable by subway but very occasionally there are bad subway delays and it’ll take 45 min to get home (maybe 2 or 3 times a year in my experience).   the uws is great - plentiful grocery stores, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, parks (riverside and central park), event centers (beacon theater, lincoln center), movie theaters, etc. i feel safe (i am also a woman). as a young woman living alone with a similar budget in nyc (~2021/2022) i lived in fidi at the time by seaport! loved it! fairly quiet but accessible to everything. quick walk to fulton st. and world trade. greenwich village! i love it here and it's right next to all the trains that take you to world trade. how has nobody mentioned tribeca yet?   you should need to be approved to comment in this sub lol dumbo / bk heights and bpc are both pretty close and have parks. you'll find something in your budget. i am sorry but when you mean 5-7k budget, you mean like a housing budget of that ? if so then you will be very comfortable there is some legitimately bad advice in this thread. please don't listen to anyone telling you to go to jersey or bay ridge  i would definitely focus on the west village, tribeca and lower chelsea. very quick commutes and some of the nicest and most popular areas in the city. battery park city is very nice but you almost don't feel like you're living in nyc because there is almost nothing to do, and it's incredibly quiet and isolated. maybe that appeals to you coming from elsewhere, though? fidi also isn't a terrible choice, but that's definitely less nice, and more ""city like"", if you will west village is the answer. safe, charming, every kind of restaurants, bar, park, shop. you're super close to east village, soho, nolita, tribeca, etc this thread makes me feel incredibly broke. definitely look over in brooklyn! dumbo and brooklyn heights are great especially with the brooklyn bridge park right there and right across the bridge is lower manhattan. williamsburg would check off almost your boxes as well but it’s a bit further from wtc my family has a place in tribeca, and i can answer any questions you might have about the area. my parents like the area because it's very safe, has water views, has lots of running paths, has plenty of groceries/shopping, had a walkable commute to downtown, and is near almost all the train lines.  i live in the ues which a different vibe but equally great. i can consistently take multiple trains without transferring to wtc in \~25 mins, but it's hard to beat a 10-15m walk. west village if you are single… poppin area lots of fun and very easy to get to work for you nice brag lol tribeca! i just gotta say this is one of the better written posts of this nature. thanks for providing enough info up front for people to actually help you and give you relevant insights i work right near you….. forgive me if this is bad advice buuuut, for that amount a month maybe buy something? i live in queens and take the lirr to either penn or grand central…..  long island city, you can take the 7 to the 1 train, and maybe buy an apt with really nice amenities?  you can get a whole house? i want your job whatever it is brooklyn heights west village 10/10.  do not live in bpc. west village! oklahoma and commute. west village, soho, or tribeca  you have the budget for upscale downtown neighborhoods - i’d take advantage of it  i lived in dumbo. wouldn’t recommend it if you’re single. nice units but it’s not for your demographic. families and tourists in dumbo stfu what do you do for work if you don’t mind me asking? bpc is the best area in downtown. close to all the hotspots but beautiful, calm, safe, clean and free of tourists i would move to jersey city and get the view of manhattan from one of those fancy apartments and travel through path to make it to wtc lol with that budget, why don't you just rent one of those apts in the financial district? you'll be able to walk to work and battery park is there for your dog. you could also walk along the pier. brooklyn heights may be an option too. otherwise definitely west side. i like tribeca or west soho or west village (so walkable and nice) i love bpc safe quiet easy to get everywhere bpc w a dog. so many walks and parks. like someone else said, live somewhere peaceful go to the village for fun. bpc is full of life on the weekends! it is a very family centric neighborhood so there are mostly low key community events and restaurants. but you can easily walk to tribeca and soho for shopping and bars. the west side highway park and its protected bike lane make it so easy to get to meat packing or chelsea for museums galleries and more restaurants. and, you have easy access to almost every subway line. it’s also so clean like the cleanest neighborhood in manhattan. i used to live in the gateway apartments in battery park. there was parking security to enter the complex, and then a doorman in each building so i always felt very safe. it’s about a 6 minute walk to 1wt, and if it’s raining, a 2 minute walk to brookfield place which has an underground tunnel (very safe) into the oculus with access to most subway lines.   i thought the apartments were overpriced for what they were, but it’s still under budget for you. there’s a key card entrance to the esplanade (boardwalk) and lots of green space along it. if safety and commute to work is your main concern, i would highly recommend living there. if being walkable to a good social scene and good food is a concern, absolutely not. it’s at least a 20-30 minute walk to anywhere decent for food or drinks. newport in jersey city. path is right there, it’s on the water and the view is better than anything in the city. 10 min train to world trade. much cleaner and the buildings are all luxury. brooklyn heights honestly tribeca house makes sense. equinox is in the building. whole foods and target are a block away. there’s greenery in walking distance (though not right next to you) and it is minutes from wtc. not going to be popular in this sub but living on hudson street in hoboken while working at 1wtc was so ideal. super safe, great dog parks and green space, path commute was 20 minutes door to door, and there is a great bus route if you ever need to go to midtown. plus, the tax break you give yourself is material. hoboken greenwich village, soho, brooklyn heights should be the only places you’re looking and in that order hey, me and my pupper are researching for our next move, and so far our favorite dog friendly luxury doorman building is [19 dutch](https://19dutch.com/) pending gf approval. here is their website, 1br range from $5100-6500. no pet fee.  good luck and probably bump into you at the dog park. is that your budget for rent or all your living expenses? wv & soho, tribeca have cute shops, restaurants . bpc is waterfront & has tons of recreational space at your fingertips. which do you like? i love battery park city but then again, i’m at a point in my life where i long for, and value, quiet. it’s nice in the summer time, grand banks is just right there on the hudson! i lived in battery park city with my gf happy to answer any questions you can dm me if that’s easier i loved living in battery park city; however, with your budget i would give bk heights a good look too. it’s incredible and a short subway ride to wtc if you know people in a specific neighborhood, a friend told me to look where the friends are. so if you have friends in fidi/tribeca/greenwich village you’d def be happy in that area. theres a lot to do and explore in those areas (i’m also jealous of your budget!!) battery park city or dumbo/bk heights. no brainer with your budget. fidi west village or tribeca. i don’t know any anyone is recommending brooklyn. the commute won’t be fun. west village or chelsea!! both incredible neighborhoods that will be walkable to your work within 30m if the weather’s nice, and direct subways to financial district i have no fee doorman building in the west village close to the one train not near the water would be perfect. post towers is the best building in the area in that price range and very close. great location, great building. highly recommend looking into it. i work in world trade also and live in park slope close to the r train - my commute is about 20-30 mins and is very easy.  i looked at battery park city when deciding where to move and it is great for green space and an easy walk to work.  i didn’t like that there aren’t really restaurants or coffee shops in the neighborhood, and i don’t love fidi so i wouldn’t like having that as the closest neighborhood with restaurants, etc.    i think the brooklyn neighborhoods - brooklyn heights, cobble hill, park slope have a great mix of green space and liveliness and are all very safe.  the other manhattan neighborhoods mentioned (west village, chelsea, tribeca) have less green space but more going on and are super convenient to almost anywhere in manhattan. i would also think about where your friends live and being close to them if that’s important to you. west village and it’s not even close if your budget is 5-7k and you want to be close to wtc and not worry about hassle of subways breaking down you should live in either tribeca / west village.  there will be many like you there -- professional women with dogs starting a new chapter.  the hudson river park is great for dog walking as is washington sq park.  don't go to brooklyn or further uptown.  you can always move to those places after you've been in nyc a year or 2 if you really want to. tribeca or the west village chelsea or west village if you’re brand new to the city i’d suggest starting in manhattan since a number of events are over there.  however if you don’t mind at ~30-40 commute and want something more low key and have space the consider brooklyn.   i like both for different reasons. west village, tribeca, soho. some of the most expensive apartments in manhattan are there and many celebrities buy condos there, but it’s within your budget. dumbo and jersey city are suggestions for people who have lower budgets but still want nice space and amenities. being off manhattan also adds more variables to your commute, however short it is. i would never live in fidi or bpc. it’s way too dead, you have to go so far for any good restaurants, it’s definitely not the city vibe you’re looking for. chelsea, west village or dumbo… i do feel like wv is more dangerous though with unpredictable homeless  people and more crime but it’s not too bad dumbo, downtown brooklyn, west village, tribeca, soho are all good options. i would suggest lic as you can take the ferry. there are a plethora of great buildings and delicious food in walking distance. you also have a short walk to subways. but a ferry commute is my favorite, even in the cold. i would recommend tribeca, west village, upper west or upper east. battery is very family oriented and may be too calm. the rest that i mentioned have a perfect balance of calmness and city vibes. single woman with the same budget here.   i live in the east village area, but about a very short walk to soho and les. picked it mostly because it is walking distance to work and had plenty of space for me. prob a little bit of a pain to get to where you work, but my upstairs neighbor works down there, so doable.   you’ll get flooded with options from people. there are a ton of really great options though and there are pros and cons to almost all of them, some of which you won’t realize unless you move into that neighborhood.   honestly, i’ve never really felt “unsafe” in most of manhattan…particularly in the areas that tend to have apartments in that price range. this isn’t 80s-90s lower manhattan. i routinely walk around with like 10-15k worth of camera gear and headphones on and never had an issue. not to dismiss that part. just that i feel like the odds of getting hit by a car or e-bike are substantially higher than a mugging or something. there are areas out there, but probably not where you’ll be looking.   i’d search out whatever place intrigues you on google maps to find out the commute time to work. preferably there are multiple ways just to have a backup that isn’t a cab/uber.   i’d err on the cheaper side of budget when you first get here and then if it is less of a big deal if you aren’t vibing with the neighborhood.   also, if you’re coming from outside of nyc, be aware of the broker fees and other things that can jack up the cost of the move. my broker fees along were around 10k. (there are buildings without the fees, but they are pretty competitive.)   also, have like 6 months of bank statements, credit reports, 2 years of signed tax forms, and all of that stuff ready to go when you do find a place. if you have a doctor or someone who can write a letter that your dog is an “emotional support animal” , you also skirt by some potential restrictions. imo, soho, tribeca, and west village are probably your best bets (fwiw, i live in soho and work in fidi) these are lively, upper-end neighborhoods, with 1/2/3 and/or a/c/e subway lines that will take you straight to wt (e station is literally beneath the building, so i recommend that. don’t even have to go outside.) it’s a totally feasible walk as well, except maybe for northern w village. but as you’ll be reasonably close to multiple lines, you’ll rarely run into issues for both.   for recreation, you’ve got tons of cafes, shops, and restaurants, literally the best in the city. hudson river park is a great outdoor space, and dog friendly (i see people walking all the time, plus’s several dog parks.) wash sq park is also pretty good, and central park is only a short subway ride away if you need a change of pace. and usually most of your needs are pretty nearby, there are enough grocery stores, bodegas, etc scattered around.   these neighborhoods are pricey, but if your 5-7k budget is just for rent, you’ve should be more than fine, you can probably get a really nice 1bed without much problem. if that’s your total living expenses and your amt allotted to rent is lower, you can still do pretty well with studios or older apts. chinatown- two bridges-hear me out- there are rentals there for much less than your budget, a couple good buildings with elevators.  the area has galleries, art scene, interesting people.  don’t look on busy streets like east broadway ( i did rent on e bway and loved it but i didn’t have a pet there … i still miss it).  henry street, madison, monroe. those are quiet streets within a busy neighborhood.  the charm of the place is the fantastic food, the unique culture, thriving arts & your dog will love the walk to the river. there’s a nightlife unique to the area, walk over to the dimes square area, les.  you are young and single,  battery park is for families w kids.  there is nothing but malls, nice malls if you want that,  but still it’s for older. that said,  the poets house is in bpc, i like that place.  anyway from chinatown you can walk to work. i lived in tribeca as a single woman in my mid to late 20s with a dog. it felt safe and it was very dog friendly, but it was a lot of young families and everything closed near me by 8-9pm. so, if i wanted any type of nightlife i had to walk further than i liked or hop on the 1. that was years ago so maybe it’s changed, but i remember feeling a little isolated. it seems like money isn’t really a concern with that kind of budget.   why don’t you consider an airbnb or short term lease in a few different areas suggested on this thread for a few months (one month at a time) or so. i think it’d be a nice trial period before committing to a lease.  side note: i’m a women in my 20s living in lic, also working in owtc. my commute is 25mins on the express train transfer, and 40mins if i want to sit and forget on the yellow line. i lived in one of the high rises on broadway/rector and it was an amazing experience. the area is pretty quiet especially once wall street closes. it’s super safe too. you need to walk around nd see what part of town you like.    brooklyn -  dumbo -  prospect park -  williamsburg    manhattan -  west village - greenwich village -  soho - fidi if you want saftey with that money battery park is probably your best bet. easy walk to wtc can go through brookfield too we are looking for a lease takeover for our apartment (see my profile for the listing!) and we are walking distance to wtc. i also have a dog and our building is pet friendly with no fee. even if you’re not interested in our listing, look at our building!!! it’s amazing and super close to 3 grocery stores, so many quick casual dining options, coffee shops, and it doesn’t ever get creepy or too quiet taking your dog out at night. and the added security of the doorman is a plus. the building is filled with other super friendly young people (not too young) and all of the neighbors are friends!!! tired of transplants coming here stay where you at please come to tribeca. never had an issue here with safety. can walk any hour at night. should be able to find something in your budget.  it is a little isolated / quiet here but that might be your vibe. still have some restaurants neighborhood bars etc. and whole foods + happier near by. the westside would be great for you! you aren’t limited with that budget. if you really prioritize safety, there’s a good amount of new “luxury” buildings in chelsea and west chelsea that fit your requirements.   the hudson yards area feels a bit devoid of character so i wouldn’t recommend looking there, but chelsea / tribeca / greenwich are all lovely neighborhoods.   i chose fidi/seaport because of all the trains and how quiet it is at night, but if i was still single i’d choose somewhere a bit livelier! the huge perk of my area is that so many trains go through here and all of manhattan and a lot of brooklyn are quickly accessible. i’m also walking distance to all the workout studios i love in tribeca :) west village all the way!  side note: what career do you have? would you be open to giving me tips on making that kind of money? 21 west st.  look it up, i loved living in that building.  for 5-7k you should able to get a very nice 1 bd or 2bd.  if you want all the luxury of a high rise with a staff but with some art-deco new york character this is the building for you.  staff has been there since the 80s and are very friendly and dedicated.  rooms are spacious with high ceiling and big windows and great views but stay very temperate which is unusual for a high rise.  location is great because you’re not quite in the more sterile part of battery park but you’re not in grimy fidi either and subway and highway access can’t be beat.  there’s an laz parking garage across the street that’s like $500 a month (which is super cheap if you know anything about parking in manhattan).  people are pretty neighborly too.  i had to move because i was priced out but with your budget you should be fine. are you allowed to recommend jersey in this sub? williamsburg. south williamsburg to be more accurate. you’re two stops from wall street ferry and it’s a lovely/quiet/safe neighborhood that is close to action if you want it. just go live in hoboken. save your money and you’ll have access to everything you’re looking for. fort greene! it’s cute af, arguably a top 5 park in nyc (hot take i know), super safe, classy, good food, access to trains is easy.   for 5k you could get a 1-2br in a brownstone with all updated amenities.   i am 2 minutes from the park and 5 minutes from about 20 local restaurants and bars. it rules. lincoln square is a 25 min subway ride  to wtc. one train. super safe here. some nightlife on upper west side but nothing too crazy. accessible. lots of greenery and access to two parks (central park and riverside). i work in wtc too!! i live in tribeca. use to live in chelsea before. both great but one is walkable to work. wv and hudson sq are both nice too just depends how much foot traffic you prefer and vibe on the building. so brownstone or lux-building with all the bells and whistles. paulus hook, jersey city. ferry ride away to downtown manhattan. you get to see the billion dollar view rather than be in it. my son lives in west village and works in wtc. he absolutely loves living there. it’s safe and has everything he needs nearby and it’s an easy commute to wtc. ,the building next to brookefiield place has 1b/1b at 5.9k per month, comes with amenities as well bpc is barely a neighborhood, don’t live there.  tribeca, soho, west village all make for an easy commute and are some of the best places to live in the world. broad st/wall st - beyond safe.. gated community by default (new york stock exchange) - has a whole foods .. love it you should look into living right by your work on the water along the west side highway like river terrace or something there kind of expensive though so i don’t know if it’s still in your budget but they’re nice and i love that area i'd suggest looking further into brooklyn. you can get something close, just as nice,  and pocket 3-4 k instead.  i know the instinct is to splurge on something ""safe,"" but there's a lot of crime in manhattan, too, and, for some types of crime,  more than bk or queens. riverdale for sure my friend works in owt and we lives on the upper west side. has no issues with commuting and central park is right there ◡̈ brooklyn heights! super easy commute to 1wtc, awesome dog parks and super safe. battery park city look into hoboken, can take the path or ferry to wfc and walk indoors to wtc in bad weather.  will get a lot more bang for your buck on that side of the river and is very safe, very young crowd with tons of dining and bars stay in the city (greenwich village or noho). with that budget you’ll be more than fine. also be mindful of the general neighborhood median income wherever you decide to move; it’s a good thing to know and will help you to avoid overly-gentrifying a particular neighborhood. literally fidi check gateway in bpc. used to live there and walked 8 min to 3wtc. has security, pool, gym, parking, etc and you could get a 1 bed ues. take the 4/5 into work (20-25 min commute). get off at fulton. wtc is a couple of blocks away. you don’t want to work and live in the same neighborhood. battery park city is likely your best bet based on what you’ve posted. i’d agree with your friend given your combo of desires, budget, etc.   the upside of short commute and access to the rest of the city is massive. the downside for bk (depending on who you ask) i think outweighs the benefits of that short walk ability/ convenience etc if safety is a concern, i would suggest bpc or fidi so that you can walk to work. a few places in southern tribeca as well. avoiding subway and walking to work is great. you can also walk to soho, chinatown, little italy easily for a change of scenery. lincoln square ? i recommend living in the financial district! i've been here for 8 years now, and it's truly a little slice of heaven in the city. it's really safe, you can get an amazing apartment at that budget with a doorman too. you're right next to the east river which is a beautiful place to walk. it feels residential while still very nyc. we have tons of amazing restaurants too. happy to send some recs as well! battery park city hoboken or jersey city genuinely curious as to why so many comments about jersey city are getting downvoted. i’m not trying to trigger anyone into downvoting me but i really wanna know why this is unpopular. lower east side! amalgamated, hillman, seward. i used to work in tribeca and would walk everyday. it was fantastic. if the weather was iffy, grab the m9.   fine fare, trader joe’s, key food all extremely close.   it’s neighborhood-y and close to everything.  the intersection of east broadway and canal is booming with bars and restaurants that people clearly travel to frequent. so, if you're willing to go to brooklyn, i'd recommend park slope. if you get a spot close to the grand army plaza, you can take the 2 train to wtc easily. it's more geared towards families than other neighborhoods i'm seeing recommended, but (as someone without a family) i've loved it here thus far. lots of green space in prospect park, really great restaurants, plenty of shops, etc. i have a dog as well, and he's having the time of his life living this close to the park (and dog beach!)  feel free to shoot me a dm if you have any questions. :) jersey city battery park, west village, tribecca all solid options fidi is safe, accessible, easy commute to work, look into 19 dutch well with an income like that you could live in a homeless shelter you could probably find a bathroom or live in somebody's closet. i love ues near 96th street. my grandmother has lived there for years. late night walks in the community are so romantic & super safe + it’s really close to modern mile near central park for you and your furry friend. its also super close to the q train which is so efficient. i miss living in that neighborhood so much! best of luck with your search! 🫶🏾 jersey city near the waterfront. the train to wtc is like 10 mins and also you have liberty stare park on your doorstep which is massive and peaceful i know this is a nyc sub but jersey city, exchange place, it’s 1 stop away from world trade center, the stop is at the oculus which is connected to the buildings so you don’t go out  jc is miles safer than nyc, i do this commute often and it’s around 10 min door to door (assuming no delay) to one of the wtc buildings. during rush hour there’s a train like every 3-4 mins   now, if you need the life style and you go out a lot, maybe live in the city you can get a 2 bed, 1.5 bath in manhattan for that price or very easy commute from hoboken and can probably get a 3 bedroom 3 bath duplex for the same price. your choice nj and take the path into the city. hoboken jersey because u won’t be able to afford anywhere else stuytown. rent stabilized and got green space.  however commute is on 30-45 minute range. my recommendation is downtown jerseycity. i know i'll get a lot of hate for this.  you'll be right across the river 5-7k will get you more mileage in jc than nyc. commute will be under 25 mins or less. check it out! stuytown if the commute isn’t too far. otherwise i would stick with battery park city. the west village/tribeca is heavily lacking in green space. [deleted] near madison square too i work at 4wtc and i live in the low 80’s along the 2nd ave q line and it’s so nice up here! it’s called yorkville!   lively enough without being crazy like midtown/the villages (they are too busy to live in for me), between central park and carl schulz park (so many dogs there and doggie play areas!! 🥹🤩), 86th street has fairway, whole foods and shopping stores. still close to the 4/5/6 if needed.   you’d have your pick of great places up here with that budget! the q is so reliable and can get you almost anywhere in manhattan so fast. from the q 86th street platform to cortlandt st (one of the stops that can bring you to the wtc campus) is less than 20 min. you just transfer across the platform at 14th street to the r/w train and  go 5 stops. once you get there, you can stay underground into the oculus and get into most wtc buildings that way! super nice in the winter.   i would avoid moving to fidi bc it’s closed up on the weekends. even duane reades.   (34f, lived in brooklyn for 4 years and ues for 4 years. this is the best neighborhood i’ve ever lived in!)   good luck! 🍀 westchester, hoboken. [removed]",80,277,positive,0.8877406716346741,357,"and further away. i’d say brooklyn heights or dumbo. i’m sure you’ll find something in your budget. battery park city is great if you want to stay in manhattan. it’s super safe and super convenient. i would also say tribeca or west village. both are great. i live in the west village and loved it! super close to everything! and if you have kids,"
